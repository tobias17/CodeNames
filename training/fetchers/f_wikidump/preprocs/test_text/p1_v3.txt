the history of anarchism goes back to prehistory when humans arguably lived in anarchic societies long before the establishment of formal states realms or empires with the rise of organised hierarchical bodies scepticism toward authority also rose but it was not until the century that a political movement emerged during the latter half of the and the first decades of the century the anarchist movement flourished in most parts of the world and had a significant role in workers struggles for emancipation various anarchist schools of thought formed during this period anarchists have taken part in several revolutions most notably in the spanish civil war whose end marked the end of the classical era of anarchism in the last decades of the and into the century the anarchist movement has been resurgent once more

anarchism employs a diversity of tactics in order to meet its ideal ends which can be broadly separated into revolutionary and evolutionary tactics there is significant overlap between the two which are merely descriptive revolutionary tactics aim to bring down authority and state having taken a violent turn in the past evolutionary tactics aim to prefigure what an anarchist society would be like anarchist thought criticism and praxis process have played a part in diverse areas of human society criticisms of anarchism include claims that it is internally inconsistent violent or utopian






the etymological origin of anarchism is from the ancient greek anarkhia meaning without a ruler composed of the prefix ie without and the word arkhos ie leader or ruler the suffix denotes the ideological current that favours anarchy anarchism appears in english from as anarchisme and anarchy from early english usages emphasised a sense of disorder various factions within the french revolution labelled their opponents as anarchists although few such accused shared many views with later anarchists many revolutionaries of the century such as william godwin and wilhelm weitling would contribute to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation but they did not use anarchist or anarchism in describing themselves or their beliefs

the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was proudhon marking the formal birth of anarchism in the century since the and beginning in france libertarianism has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and its use as a synonym is still common outside the united states on the other hand some use libertarianism to refer to individualistic philosophy only referring to anarchism as libertarian anarchism

while the term libertarian has been largely synonymous with anarchism its meaning has more recently diluted with wider adoption from ideologically disparate groups including both the new left and libertarian marxists who do not associate themselves with authoritarian socialists or a vanguard party as well as extreme liberalism primarily concerned with civil liberties additionally some anarchists use libertarian socialist to avoid anarchisms negative connotations and emphasise its connections with socialism matthew s adams and carl levy political scientist write that anarchism is used to describe the wing of the socialist movement noam chomsky describes anarchism alongside libertarian marxism as the libertarian wing of socialism daniel wrote
anarchism is really a synonym for socialism the anarchist is primarily a socialist whose aim is to abolish the exploitation of man by man anarchism is only one of the streams of socialist thought that stream whose main components are concern for liberty and haste to abolish the state

while opposition to the state is central to anarchist thought defining anarchism is not an easy task as there is a lot of discussion among scholars and anarchists on the matter and various currents perceive anarchism slightly differently hence it might be true to say that anarchism is a cluster of political philosophies opposing authority and hierarchical organisation including anarchism and capitalism anarchism and nationalism the state and all associated in the conduct of all human relations in favour of a society based on decentralisation freedom and voluntary association however this definition has the same shortcomings as the definition based on which is an a posteriori conclusion anarchism is much more than that and etymology which is simply a negation of a ruler nonetheless major elements of the definition of anarchism include the will for a society the rejection of the state apparatus the belief that human nature allows humans to exist in or progress toward such a society and a suggestion on how to act to pursue the ideal of anarchy

herbert l osgood claimed that anarchism is the extreme antithesis of authoritarian communism and state socialism peter marshall author states that in general anarchism is closer to socialism than liberalism anarchism finds itself largely in the socialist camp but it also has outriders in liberalism it cannot be reduced to socialism and is best seen as a separate and distinctive doctrine according to jeremy jennings it is hard not to conclude that these ideas referring to are described as anarchist only on the basis of a misunderstanding of what anarchism is jennings adds that anarchism does not stand for the untrammelled freedom of the individual as the appear to believe but as we have already seen for the extension of individuality and community nicolas walter wrote that anarchism does derive from liberalism and socialism both historically and ideologically in a sense anarchists always remain liberals and socialists and whenever they reject what is good in either they betray anarchism itself we are liberals but more so and socialists but more so michael newman includes anarchism as one of many socialist traditions especially the more tradition following proudhon and mikhail bakunin brian morris anthropologist argues that it is conceptually and historically misleading to create a dichotomy between socialism and anarchism






during the prehistoric era of mankind an established authority did not exist it was after the creation of towns and cities that institutions of authority were established and anarchistic ideas espoused as a reaction the most notable precursors to anarchism in the ancient world were in china and greece in china philosophical anarchism ie the discussion on the legitimacy of the state was delineated by taoist philosophers zhuang zhou and laozi alongside stoicism taoism has been said to have had significant anticipations of anarchism

anarchic attitudes were also articulated by tragedians and philosophers in greece aeschylus and sophocles used the myth of antigone to illustrate the conflict between rules set by the state and personal autonomy socrates questioned athenian authorities constantly and insisted on the right of individual freedom of conscience cynicism philosophy dismissed human law nomos and associated authorities while trying to live according to nature physis stoics were supportive of a society based on unofficial and friendly relations among its citizens without the presence of a state

during the middle ages there was no anarchistic activity except some ascetic religious movements in the muslim world or in christian europe this kind of tradition later gave birth to religious anarchism in the sasanian empire mazdak called for an egalitarian society and the abolition of monarchy only to be soon executed by emperor kavad i

in basra religious sects preached against the state in europe various sects developed and libertarian tendencies libertarian ideas further emerged during the renaissance with the spread of humanism rationalism and reasoning through europe novelists fictionalised ideal societies that were based on voluntarism rather than coercion the age of enlightenment further pushed towards anarchism with the optimism for social progress


during the french revolution partisan groups such as the and the saw a turning point in the fermentation of and federalist sentiments the first anarchist currents developed throughout the century as william godwin espoused philosophical anarchism in england morally delegitimising the state max stirners thinking paved the way to individualist anarchism and proudhons theory of mutualism economic theory found fertile soil in france by the late various anarchist schools of thought had become and a wave of then unprecedented globalization occurred from to this era of classical anarchism lasted until the end of the spanish civil war and is considered the golden age of anarchism


drawing from mutualism mikhail bakunin founded collectivist anarchism and entered the international workingmens association a class worker union later known as the first international that formed in to unite diverse revolutionary currents the international became a significant political force with karl marx being a leading figure and a member of its general council bakunins faction the jura federation and proudhons followers the mutualists opposed state socialism advocating political abstentionism and small property holdings after bitter disputes the bakuninists were expelled from the international by the marxists at the hague congress anarchists were treated similarly in the second international being ultimately expelled in bakunin famously predicted that if revolutionaries gained power by marxs terms they would end up the new tyrants of workers in response to their expulsion from the first international anarchists formed the st imier international under the influence of peter kropotkin a russian philosopher and scientist overlapped with collectivism who drew inspiration from the paris commune advocated for free federation and for the distribution of goods according to ones needs

at the turn of the century anarchism had spread all over the world it was a notable feature of the international syndicalism movement in china small groups of students imported the humanistic version of tokyo was a hotspot for rebellious youth from countries of the far east travelling to the japanese capital to study in latin america anarchism in argentina was a stronghold for where it became the most prominent ideology during this time a minority of anarchists adopted tactics of revolutionary political violence this strategy became known as propaganda of the deed the dismemberment of the french socialist movement into many groups and the execution and exile of many communards to penal colonies following the suppression of the paris commune favoured individualist political expression and acts even though many anarchists distanced themselves from these terrorist acts infamy came upon the movement and attempts were made to exclude them from american immigration including the immigration act of also called the anarchist exclusion act illegalism was another strategy which some anarchists adopted during this period


despite concerns anarchists enthusiastically participated in the russian revolution in opposition to the white movement however they met harsh suppression after the bolshevik government was stabilized several anarchists from petrograd and moscow fled to ukraine notably leading to the kronstadt rebellion and nestor makhnos struggle in the free territory with the anarchists being crushed in russia two new antithetical currents emerged namely platformism and synthesis anarchism the former sought to create a coherent group that would push for revolution while the latter were against anything that would resemble a political party seeing the victories of the bolsheviks in the october revolution and the resulting russian civil war many workers and activists turned to communist parties which grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements in france and the united states members of major syndicalist movements such as the general confederation of labour france and the industrial workers of the world left their organisations and joined the communist international

in the spanish civil war of anarchists and syndicalists nacional del trabajo and anarquista once again allied themselves with various currents of leftists a long tradition of spanish anarchism led to anarchists playing a pivotal role in the war in response to the army rebellion an movement of peasants and workers supported by armed militias took control of barcelona and of large areas of rural spain where they collectivised the land the soviet union provided some limited assistance at the beginning of the war but the result was a bitter fight among communists and anarchists at a series of events named may days as joseph stalin tried to seize control of the republican faction spanish civil war



at the end of world war ii the anarchist movement was severely weakened however the witnessed a revival of anarchism likely caused by a perceived failure of and tensions built by the cold war during this time anarchism found a presence in other movements critical towards both capitalism and the state such as the movement environmental movement and peace movements the counterculture of the and the new left it also saw a transition from its previous revolutionary nature to provocative reformism anarchism became associated with punk subculture as exemplified by bands such as crass and the sex pistols the established feminist tendencies of returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism black anarchism began to take form at this time and influenced anarchisms move from a eurocentric demographic this coincided with its failure to gain traction in northern europe and its unprecedented height in latin america

around the turn of the century anarchism grew in popularity and influence within and movements anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the world trade organization wto the group of eight and the world economic forum during the protests ad hoc leaderless anonymous cadres known as black blocs engaged in rioting property destruction and violent confrontations with the police other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include affinity groups security culture and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet a significant event of this period was the confrontations at the seattle wto conference anarchist ideas have been influential in the development of the zapatista army of national liberation in mexico and the democratic federation of northern syria more commonly known as rojava a de facto permanent autonomous zone in northern syria



anarchist schools of thought have been generally grouped into two main historical traditions social anarchism and individualist anarchism owing to their different origins values and evolution the individualist current emphasises negative liberty in opposing restraints upon the free individual while the social current emphasises positive liberty in aiming to achieve the free potential of society through equality and social ownership in a chronological sense anarchism can be segmented by the classical currents of the late century and the currents green anarchism and developed thereafter

beyond the specific factions of anarchist movements which constitute political anarchism lies philosophical anarchism which holds that the state lacks moral legitimacy without necessarily accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it a component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may tolerate the existence of a minimal state but it argues that citizens have no moral obligation to obey government when it conflicts with individual autonomy anarchism pays significant attention to moral arguments since ethics have a central role in anarchist philosophy anarchisms emphasis on egalitarianism and for the extension of community and individuality sets it apart from and other types of economic libertarianism

anarchism is usually placed on the of the political spectrum much of its anarchist economics and anarchist law reflect libertarian and radical politics interpretations of and socialist politics such as collectivist anarchism individualist anarchism mutualism economic theory and among other libertarian socialist economic theories as anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular worldview many anarchist types and traditions exist and varieties of anarchy diverge widely one reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was anarchism without adjectives a call for toleration and unity among anarchists first adopted by fernando tarrida del in in response to the bitter debates of anarchist theory at the time belief in political nihilism has been espoused by anarchists despite separation the various anarchist schools of thought are not seen as distinct entities but rather as tendencies that intermingle and are connected through a set of uniform principles such as individual and local autonomy mutual aid network organisation communal democracy justified authority and decentralisation



inceptive currents among classical anarchist currents were mutualism economic theory and individualist anarchism they were followed by the major currents of social anarchism collectivist anarchism and they differ on organisational and economic aspects of their ideal society

mutualism is an economic theory that was developed into anarchist theory by proudhon its aims include reciprocity cultural anthropology free association marxism and anarchism voluntary contract federation and monetary reform of both credit and currency that would be regulated by a bank of the people mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism in what is proudhon first characterised his goal as a third form of society the synthesis of communism and property collectivist anarchism is a revolutionary socialist form of anarchism commonly associated with mikhail bakunin collectivist anarchists advocate collective ownership of the means of production which is theorised to be achieved through violent revolution and that workers be paid according to time worked rather than goods being distributed according to need as in communism collectivist anarchism arose alongside marxism but it rejected the dictatorship of the proletariat despite the stated marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society

is a theory of anarchism that advocates a communist society with common ownership of the means of production direct democracy and a horizontalidad network of voluntary associations workers councils and worker cooperatives with production and consumption based on the guiding principle from each according to his ability to each according to his need developed from radical socialist currents after the french revolution but it was first formulated as such in the italian section of the first international it was later expanded upon in the theoretical work of peter kropotkin whose specific style would go onto become the dominating view of anarchists by the late century is a branch of anarchism that views labour syndicates as a potential force for revolutionary social change replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically by workers the basic principles of are direct action workers solidarity and workers

individualist anarchism is a set of several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the individual and their will philosophy over any kinds of external determinants early influences on individualist forms of anarchism include william godwin max stirner and henry david thoreau through many countries individualist anarchism attracted a small yet diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and individual reclamation




anarchist principles undergird contemporary radical social movements of the left interest in the anarchist movement developed alongside momentum in the movement whose leading activist networks were anarchist in orientation as the movement shaped century radicalism wider embrace of anarchist principles signaled a revival of interest anarchism has continued to generate many philosophies and movements at times eclectic drawing upon various sources and syncretic combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches the tradition of classical anarchism has remained prominent within contemporary currents

contemporary news coverage which emphasizes black bloc demonstrations has reinforced anarchisms historical association with chaos and violence however its publicity has also led more scholars in fields such as anthropology and history to engage with the anarchist movement although contemporary anarchism favours actions over academic theory various anarchist groups tendencies and schools of thought exist today making it difficult to describe the contemporary anarchist movement while theorists and activists have established relatively stable constellations of anarchist principles there is no consensus on which principles are core and commentators describe multiple anarchisms rather than a singular anarchism in which common principles are shared between schools of anarchism while each group prioritizes those principles differently gender equality can be a common principle although it ranks as a higher priority to than

anarchists are generally committed against coercive authority in all forms namely all centralized and hierarchical forms of government eg monarchy representative democracy state socialism etc economic class systems eg capitalism bolshevism feudalism slavery etc autocratic religions eg fundamentalist islam roman catholicism etc patriarchy heterosexism white supremacy and imperialism however anarchist schools disagree on the methods by which these forms should be opposed the principle of equal liberty is closer to anarchist political ethics in that it transcends both the liberal and socialist traditions this entails that liberty and equality cannot be implemented within the state resulting in the questioning of all forms of domination and hierarchy


anarchists tactics take various forms but in general they serve two major goals namely to first oppose the establishment and secondly to promote anarchist ethics and reflect an anarchist vision of society illustrating the unity of means and ends a broad categorisation can be made between aims to destroy oppressive states and institutions by revolutionary means on one hand and aims to change society through evolutionary means on the other evolutionary tactics embrace nonviolence reject violence and take a gradual approach to anarchist aims although there is significant overlap between the two

anarchist tactics have shifted during the course of the last century anarchists during the early century focused more on strikes and militancy while contemporary anarchists use a broader array of approaches



during the classical era anarchists had a militant tendency not only did they confront state armed forces as in spain and ukraine but some of them also employed terrorism as propaganda of the deed assassination attempts were carried out against heads of state some of which were successful anarchists also took part in revolutions many anarchists especially the galleanists believed that these attempts would be the impetus for a revolution against capitalism and the state many of these attacks were done by individual assailants and the majority took place in the late the early and the with some still occurring in the early their decrease in prevalence was the result of further judicial power and targeting and cataloging by state institutions

anarchist perspectives towards violence have always been perplexing and controversial on one hand point out the unity of means and ends on the other hand other anarchist groups advocate direct action a tactic which can include acts of sabotage or even acts of terrorism this attitude was quite prominent a century ago when seeing the state as a tyrant and some anarchists believing that they had every right to oppose its oppression by any means possible emma goldman and errico malatesta who were proponents of limited use of violence argued that violence is merely a reaction to state violence as a necessary evil

anarchists took an active role in strike actions although they tended to be antipathetic to formal syndicalism seeing it as reformism they saw it as a part of the movement which sought to overthrow the state polity and capitalism anarchists also reinforced their propaganda within the arts some of whom practiced naturism and nudism those anarchists also built communities which were based on friendship and were involved in the news media



in the current era italian anarchist alfredo bonanno a proponent of insurrectionary anarchism has reinstated the debate on violence by rejecting the nonviolence tactic adopted since the late century by kropotkin and other prominent anarchists afterwards both bonanno and the french group the invisible committee advocate for small informal affiliation groups where each member is responsible for their own actions but works together to bring down oppression utilizing sabotage and other violent means against state capitalism and other enemies members of the invisible committee were arrested in on various charges terrorism included

overall contemporary anarchists are much less violent and militant than their ideological ancestors they mostly engage in confronting the police during demonstrations and riots especially in countries such as anarchism in canada anarchism in greece and anarchism in mexico militant black bloc protest groups are known for clashing with the police however anarchists not only clash with state they also engage in the struggle against fascists and racists taking action and mobilizing to prevent hate rallies from happening


anarchists commonly employ direct action this can take the form of disrupting and protesting against unjust hierarchy or the form of their lives through the creation of such as communes and collectives is often handled in an way with everyone having equal say in each decision an approach known as horizontalism anarchists have been engaging with various grassroots movements that are more or less based on horizontalism although not explicitly anarchist respecting personal autonomy and participating in mass activism such as strikes and demonstrations in contrast with the anarchism of the classical era the newly coined term anarchism signals their tendency not to base their thoughts and actions on anarchism or to refer to classical anarchists such as peter kropotkin and proudhon to justify their opinions those anarchists would rather base their thought and praxis on their own experience which they will later theorize

the process of small anarchist affinity groups plays a significant tactical role anarchists have employed various methods in order to build a rough consensus among members of their group without the need of a leader or a leading group one way is for an individual from the group to play the role of facilitator to help achieve a consensus without taking part in the discussion themselves or promoting a specific point minorities usually accept rough consensus except when they feel the proposal contradicts anarchist ethics goals and values anarchists usually form small groups individuals to enhance autonomy and friendships among their members these kinds of groups more often than not interconnect with each other forming larger networks anarchists still support and participate in strikes especially wildcat strike action as these are leaderless strikes not organised centrally by a syndicate

as in the past newspapers and journals are used but anarchists have gone online in the world wide web to spread their message however anarchists have found it easier to create websites because of distributional and other difficulties hosting electronic libraries and other portals anarchists were also involved in developing various software that are available for free the way these hacktivists work to develop and distribute resembles the anarchist ideals especially when it comes to preserving users privacy from state surveillance

anarchists organize themselves to squatting and reclaim public spaces during important events such as protests and when spaces are being occupied they are often called temporary autonomous zones taz spaces where art poetry and surrealism are blended to display the anarchist ideal as seen by anarchists squatting is a way to regain urban space from the capitalist market serving pragmatical needs and also being an exemplary direct action acquiring space enables anarchists to experiment with their ideas and build social bonds adding up these tactics while having in mind that not all anarchists share the same attitudes towards them along with various forms of protesting at highly symbolic events make up a carnivalesque atmosphere that is part of contemporary anarchist vividity




as anarchism is a philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes tendencies and schools of thought disagreement over questions of values ideology and tactics is common its diversity has led to widely different uses of identical terms among different anarchist traditions which has created a number of definitional concerns in anarchist theory the compatibility of anarchism and capitalism anarchism and nationalism and anarchism and religion with anarchism is widely disputed similarly anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as anarchism and communism collectivism anarchism and marxism and trade unionism anarchists may be motivated by humanism god enlightened veganarchism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines phenomena such as civilisation technology eg within and the anarchism and statist democracy may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others




as gender and sexuality carry along them dynamics of hierarchy anarchism is obliged to address analyse and oppose the suppression of ones autonomy because of the dynamics that gender roles traditionally impose


sexuality was not often discussed by classical anarchists but the few that did felt that an anarchist society would lead to sexuality naturally developing however sexual violence was a concern for anarchists such as benjamin tucker who opposed age of consent laws believing they would benefit predatory men a historical current that arose and flourished during and within anarchism was free love in contemporary anarchism this current survives as a tendency to support polyamory and queer anarchism free love advocates were against marriage which they saw as a way of men imposing authority over women largely because marriage law greatly favoured the power of men the notion of free love was much broader and included a critique of the established order that limited womens sexual freedom and pleasure those free love movements contributed to the establishment of communal houses where large groups of travelers anarchists and other activists slept in beds together free love had roots both in europe and the united states however some anarchists struggled with the jealousy that arose from free love anarchist feminists were advocates of free love against marriage utilising a contemporary term and had a similar agenda anarchist and feminists differed on suffrage but they were nonetheless supportive of one another

during the second half of the century anarchism intermingled with the second wave of feminism radicalising some currents of the feminist movement and being influenced as well by the latest decades of the century anarchists and feminists were advocating for the rights and autonomy of women gays queers and other marginalised groups with some feminist thinkers suggesting a fusion of the two currents with the third wave of feminism sexual identity and compulsory heterosexuality became a subject of study for anarchists yielding a critique of sexual normality however some anarchists distanced themselves from this line of thinking suggesting that it leaned towards an individualism that was dropping the cause of social liberation


















the interest of anarchists in education stretches back to the first emergence of classical anarchism anarchists consider proper education one which sets the foundations of the future autonomy of the individual and the society to be an act of mutual aid organization theory anarchist writers such as william godwin political justice and max stirner the false principle of our education attacked both state education and private education as another means by which the ruling class replicate their privileges

in catalan anarchist and free thinker francisco ferrer established the escuela moderna in barcelona as an opposition to the established education system which was dictated largely by the catholic church ferrers approach was secular rejecting both state and church involvement in the educational process whilst giving pupils large amounts of autonomy in planning their work and attendance ferrer aimed to educate the working class and explicitly sought to foster class consciousness among students the school closed after constant harassment by the state and ferrer was later arrested nonetheless his ideas formed the inspiration for a series of modern school united states around the world christian anarchist leo tolstoy who published the essay education and culture also established a similar school with its founding principle being that for education to be effective it had to be free in a similar token a s neill founded what became the summerhill school in also declaring being free from coercion

anarchist education is based largely on the idea that a childs right to develop freely and without manipulation ought to be respected and that rationality will lead children to morally good conclusions however there has been little consensus among anarchist figures as to what constitutes manipulation ferrer believed that moral indoctrination was necessary and explicitly taught pupils that equality liberty and social justice were not possible under capitalism along with other critiques of government and nationalism

late century and contemporary anarchist writers colin ward herbert read and paul goodman intensified and expanded the anarchist critique of state education largely focusing on the need for a system that focuses on childrens creativity rather than on their ability to attain a career or participate in consumerism as part of a consumer society contemporary anarchists such as ward have further argued that state education serves to perpetuate socioeconomic inequality

while few anarchist education institutions have survived to the major tenets of anarchist schools among them respect for child autonomy and relying on reasoning rather than indoctrination as a teaching method have spread among mainstream educational institutions judith suissa names three schools as explicitly anarchists schools namely the free skool santa cruz in the united states which is part of a wider network of schools the learning college in brighton england and the paideia school in spain



objection to the state polity and its institutions is a sine qua non of anarchism anarchists consider the state as a tool of domination and believe it to be illegitimate regardless of its political tendencies instead of people being able to control the aspects of their life major decisions are taken by a small elite authority ultimately rests solely on power regardless of whether that power is open government or transparency behavior as it still has the ability to coerce people another anarchist argument against states is that the people constituting a government even the most altruistic among officials will unavoidably seek to gain more power leading to corruption anarchists consider the idea that the state is the collective will of the people to be an unachievable fiction due to the fact that the ruling class is distinct from the rest of society

specific anarchist attitudes towards the state vary robert paul wolff believed that the tension between authority and autonomy would mean the state could never be legitimate bakunin saw the state as meaning coercion domination by means of coercion camouflaged if possible but unceremonious and overt if need be a john simmons and leslie green philosopher who leaned toward philosophical anarchism believed that the state could be legitimate if it is governed by consensus although they saw this as highly unlikely beliefs on how to abolish the state also differ




the connection between anarchism and art was quite profound during the classical era of anarchism especially among artistic currents that were developing during that era such as futurists surrealists and others in literature anarchism was mostly associated with the new apocalyptics and the movement in music anarchism has been associated with music scenes such as punk anarchists such as leo tolstoy and herbert read argued that the border between the artist and the what separates art from a daily act is a construct produced by the alienation caused by capitalism and it prevents humans from living a joyful life

other anarchists advocated for or used art as a means to achieve anarchist ends in his book breaking the spell a history of anarchist filmmakers videotape guerrillas and digital ninjas chris claims that practices have increasingly structured video activism throughout the century many prominent anarchists peter kropotkin emma goldman gustav landauer and camillo berneri and publications such as anarchy magazine wrote about matters pertaining to the arts

three overlapping properties made art useful to anarchists it could depict a critique of existing society and hierarchies serve as a prefigurative tool to reflect the anarchist ideal society and even turn into a means of direct action such as in protests as it appeals to both emotion and reason art could appeal to the whole human and have a powerful effect the movement had an ecological aesthetic and offered an example of an anarchist perception of the road towards socialism in les chataigniers a osny by anarchist painter camille pissarro the blending of aesthetic and social harmony is prefiguring an ideal anarchistic agrarian community



the most common critique of anarchism is that humans cannot and so a state is necessary for human survival philosopher bertrand russell supported this critique stating that peace and war tariffs regulations of sanitary conditions and the sale of noxious drugs the preservation of a just system of distribution these among others are functions which could hardly be performed in a community in which there was no central government another common criticism of anarchism is that it fits a world of isolation in which only the small enough entities can be colin ward responds that major anarchist thinkers advocated anarchist federalism

philosophy lecturer andrew g fiala also believed that humans could not and included it in his list of arguments against anarchism fialas other critiques were that anarchism is innately related to violence and destruction not only in the pragmatic world ie at protests but in the world of ethics as well secondly anarchism is evaluated as unfeasible or utopian since the state can not be defeated practically this line of arguments most often calls for political action within the system to reform it the third argument is that anarchism is while it advocates for to archiei if accepted by the many then anarchism would turn into the ruling political theory in this line of criticism also comes the that anarchism calls for collective action whilst endorsing the autonomy of the individual hence no collective action can be taken lastly fiala mentions a critique towards philosophical anarchism of being ineffective all talk and thoughts and in the meantime capitalism and bourgeois class remains strong

philosophical anarchism has met the criticism of members of academia following the release of books such as a john simmons moral principles and political obligations law professor william a edmundson authored an essay arguing against three major philosophical anarchist principles which he finds fallacious edmundson claims that while the individual does not owe the state a duty of obedience this does not imply that anarchism is the inevitable conclusion and the state is still morally legitimate in the problem of political authority michael huemer defends philosophical anarchism claiming that political authority is a moral illusion

another criticism is that anarchism defies and fails to understand the biological inclination to authority as first articulated in an article for the north american review by frances l ferguson joseph raz argues that the acceptance of authority implies the belief that following their instructions will afford more success raz believes that this argument is true in following both authorities successful and mistaken instruction anarchists reject this criticism because challenging or disobeying authority does not entail the disappearance of its advantages by acknowledging authority such as doctors or lawyers as reliable nor does it involve a complete surrender of independent judgment anarchist perception of human nature rejection of the state and commitment to social revolution has been criticised by academics as naive overly simplistic and unrealistic respectively classical anarchism has been criticized for relying too heavily on the belief that the abolition of the state will lead to human cooperation prospering

friedrich engels considered to be one of the principal founders of marxism criticized as inherently academic john molyneux academic writes in his book anarchism a marxist criticism that anarchism cannot win believing that it lacks the ability to properly implement its ideas the marxist criticism of anarchism is that it has a utopian character because all individuals should have anarchist views and values according to the marxist view that a social idea would follow directly from this human ideal and out of the free will of every individual formed its essence marxists argue that this contradiction was responsible for their inability to act in the anarchist vision the conflict between liberty and equality was resolved through coexistence and intertwining













































































































































































































































































































































































































































































autism is a developmental disorder characterized by difficulties with social interaction and communication and by restricted and repetitive behavior parents often notice signs during the first three years of their childs life these signs often develop gradually though some autistic children experience regressive autism in their communication and social skills after reaching developmental milestones at a normal pace


autism is associated with a combination of heritability of autism and environmental factors risk factors during pregnancy include certain infections such as rubella toxins including valproic acid alcohol cocaine pesticides lead and air pollution fetal growth restriction and autoimmune diseases controversies in autism surround other proposed environmental causes of for example the mmr vaccine and autism which has been disproven autism affects information processing in the brain and how nerve cells and their synapses connect and how this occurs is not well understood the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders combines forms of the condition including asperger syndrome and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified into the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder asd


early applied behavior analysis or speech therapy can help autistic children gain social and communication skills although there is no known cure there have been cases of children who have achieved good outcomes some autistic adults are unable to live independently an societal and cultural aspects of autism has developed with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be autism rights movement to be accommodated instead of cured


globally autism is estimated to affect million people in the the number of people with autism worldwide was estimated at per people in the developed countries about of children are diagnosed with asd from in in the united states it occurs times more often in males than females the number of people diagnosed has increased dramatically since the which may be partly due to changes in diagnostic practice the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved



autism is a highly variable neurodevelopmental disorder whose symptoms first appear during infancy or childhood and generally follows a steady course without remission medicine autistic people may be severely impaired in some respects but average or even superior in others overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months become established by age two or three years and tend to continue through adulthood although often in more muted form it is distinguished by a characteristic triad of symptoms impairments in social interaction impairments in communication and repetitive behavior other aspects such as atypical eating are also common but are not essential for diagnosis individual symptoms of autism occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits


social deficits distinguish autism and the related autism spectrum disorders see from other developmental disorders autistic people have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted noted autistic temple grandin described her inability to understand the social communication of neurotypicals or people with typical neural development as leaving her feeling like an anthropologist on mars

unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli smile and look at others less often and respond less to their own name autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from social for example they have less eye contact and and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves such as pointing at things to autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding approach others spontaneously imitate and respond to emotions communicate nonverbal autismly and take turns with others however they do form attachment psychology to their primary caregivers most autistic children display moderately less attachment in attachment than neurotypical children although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less pronounced autistic traits older children and adults with asd face individuals with autism spectrum disorder although this may be partly due to a alexithymia

children with autism have more intense and frequent loneliness compared to peers despite the common belief that autistic children prefer to be alone making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism for them the quality of friendships not the number of friends predicts how lonely they feel functional friendships such as those resulting in invitations to parties may affect the quality of life more deeply


there are many anecdotal reports but few systematic studies of aggression and violence in individuals with asd the limited data suggest that in children with intellectual disability autism is associated with aggression destruction of property and meltdowns


about a third to a half of autistic people do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs differences in communication may be present from the first year of life and may include delayed onset of babbling unusual gestures diminished responsiveness and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver in the second and third years autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling consonants words and word their gestures are less often integrated with words autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences and are more likely to simply repeat others words echolalia or pronoun reversal joint attention seems to be necessary for functional speech and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with asd for example they may look at a pointing hand instead of the object and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language

in a pair of studies autistic children aged performed equally well as and as adults better than individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language comprehension and inference as people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends



autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior which the repetitive behavior categorizes as follows








no single repetitive or behavior seems to be specific to autism but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors


autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis but that can affect the individual or the family this paper represents a consensus of representatives from nine professional and four parent organizations in the us
an estimated to of individuals with asd show unusual abilities ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious savant syndrome many individuals with asd show superior skills in perception and attention relative to the general population sensory system abnormalities are found in over of autistic people and are considered core features by some although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders differences are greater for for example walking into things than for for example distress from loud noises or for sensation seeking for example rhythmic movements an estimated of autistic people have motor signs that include hypotonia apraxia and toe deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across asd and are greater in autism proper unusual eating behavior occurs in about of children with asd to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator selectivity is the most common problem although eating rituals and food refusal also occur

there is tentative evidence that gender dysphoria occurs more frequently in autistic people

gastrointestinal diseases are one of the most commonly comorbidity in autistic people these are linked to greater social impairment irritability behavior and sleep problems language impairments and mood changes

parents of children with asd have higher levels of stress book fr paul r pelphrey ka rogers sj of autism and pervasive developmental disorders volume two assessment interventions and policy wiley sons new jersey march siblings of children with asd report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with down syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship however they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with down siblings of individuals with asd have greater risk of negative and poorer sibling relationships as adults




it has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic cognitive and neural levels for autisms characteristic triad of symptoms however there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often


autism has a strong genetic basis although the heritability of autism are complex and it is unclear whether asd is explained more by rare mutations with major effects or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes the environment and epigenetic factors which do not change dna sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents studies of twins suggest that heritability is for autism and as high as for asd and siblings of those with autism are about times more likely to be autistic than the general population however most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified typically autism cannot be traced to a mendelian mutation or to a single chromosome abnormality and none of the genetic syndromes associated with asds have been shown to selectively cause asd numerous candidate genes have been located with only small effects attributable to any particular gene most loci individually explain less than of cases of autism the large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous structural as deletion genetics gene duplication or chromosomal inversion in genetic material during meiosis hence a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited that is the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome autism may be underdiagnosed in women and girls due to an assumption that it is primarily a male condition thousands of autistic girls and women going undiagnosed due to gender bias the guardian but genetic phenomena such as genomic imprinting and x linkage have the ability to raise the frequency and severity of conditions in males and theories have been put forward for a genetic reason why males are diagnosed more often such as the imprinted brain hypothesis and the extreme male brain theory

maternal nutrition and inflammation during preconception and pregnancy influences fetal neurodevelopment intrauterine growth restriction is associated with asd in both term and preterm infants maternal inflammatory and autoimmune diseases may damage fetal tissues aggravating a genetic problem or damaging the nervous system

exposure to air pollution during pregnancy especially heavy metal chemistry and particulates may increase the risk of autism environmental factors that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods infectious diseases solvents polychlorinated biphenyl phthalates and phenols used in plastic products pesticides brominated flame retardants ethanol smoking illicit drugs vaccines and prenatal stress some such as the mmr vaccine have been completely disproven

parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination this has led to unsupported theories blaming vaccine overload a thiomersal controversy or the mmr vaccine and autism for causing autism the latter theory was supported by a study that has since been shown to have been an elaborate fraud although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of childhood immunizations mmr vaccine and outbreaks in some countries and the preventable deaths of several childrenvaccines and autism









autisms symptoms result from changes in various systems of the brain how autism occurs is not well understood its mechanism can be divided into two areas the pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism and the neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors the behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies

there is evidence that axis abnormalities may be involved a review proposed that immune dysregulation gastrointestinal tract inflammation malfunction of the autonomic nervous system gut flora alterations and food metabolites may cause brain neuroinflammation and dysfunction a review concludes that enteric nervous system abnormalities might play a role in neurological disorders such as autism neural connections and the immune system are a pathway that may allow diseases originated in the intestine to spread to the brain

several lines of evidence point to synapse dysfunction as a cause of autism some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways such as those involved with cell adhesion gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on changes all known teratogens agents that cause birth defects related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from human fertilization and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development


medical diagnosis is based on behavior not cause or mechanism under the autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts as well as restricted repetitive patterns of behavior interests or activities these deficits are present in early childhood typically before age three and lead to clinically significant functional impairment sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity stereotyped and repetitive use of language or and psychology and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects the disturbance must not be better accounted for by rett syndrome intellectual disability or global developmental delay uses essentially the same definition

several diagnostic instruments are available two are commonly used in autism research the autism diagnostic is a semistructured parent interview and the autism diagnostic observation schedule ados uses observation and interaction with the child the childhood autism rating scale cars is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children the diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders disco may also be used

a pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child if warranted diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from asd specialists observing and assessing cognitive communication family and other factors using standardized tools and taking into account any associated medical conditions a pediatric neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions a differential diagnosis for asd at this stage might also consider intellectual disability hearing impairment and a specific language impairment such as syndrome the presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder

clinical genetics evaluations are often done once asd is diagnosed particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated of cases to genetic causes consensus guidelines in the us and uk are limited to chromosome and fragile x testing a approach model of diagnosis has been proposed which would routinely assess the genomes copy number variations as new genetic tests are developed several ethical legal and social issues will emerge commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results given the complexity of autisms genetics metabolic and neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful but are not routine

asd can sometimes be diagnosed by age months although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life for example a who meets diagnostic criteria for asd is less likely than a to continue to do so a few years later in the uk the national autism plan for children recommends at most weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment though few cases are handled that quickly in practice although the symptoms of autism and asd begin early in childhood they are sometimes years later adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves to help their employers make adjustments or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits

signs of autism may be more challenging for clinicians to detect in females autistic females have been shown to engage in masking more frequently than autistic males masking may include making oneself perform normative facial expressions and eye contact a notable percentage of autistic females may be misdiagnosed diagnosed after a considerable delay or not diagnosed at all

conversely the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis it is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the visually impaired partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or blindisms


autism is one of the five pervasive developmental disorders pdd which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior these symptoms do not imply sickness fragility or emotional disturbance

of the five pdd forms asperger syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely rett syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder share several signs with autism but may have unrelated pdd not otherwise specified also called atypical autism is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder unlike with autism people with asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in language development the terminology of autism can be bewildering with autism asperger syndrome and often called the autism spectrum disorders asd or sometimes the autistic disorders whereas autism itself is often called autistic disorder childhood autism or infantile autism in this article autism refers to the classic autistic in clinical practice though autism asd and pdd are often used interchangeably asd in turn is a subset of the broader autism phenotype which describes individuals who may not have asd but do have phenotypic trait such as avoiding eye contact

research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of psychiatry psychology neurology and pediatrics newer technologies such as fmri and diffusion tensor imaging can help identify biologically relevant phenotypes observable traits that can be viewed on brain scans to help further neurogenetic studies of one example is lowered activity in the fusiform face area of the brain which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects it has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior


autism has long been thought to cover a wide spectrum disorder ranging from individuals with severe may be silent developmentally disabled and prone to frequent repetitive behavior such as hand flapping and high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches narrowly focused interests and verbose pedantic communication because the behavior spectrum is continuous boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary


about half of parents of children with asd notice their childs unusual behaviors by age months and about notice by age months according to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the outcome







the united states preventive services task force in found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concern the japanese practice is to screening medicine all children for asd at and months using formal screening tests in contrast in the uk children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened it is not known which approach is more effective screening tools include the modified checklist for autism in toddlers the early screening of autistic traits questionnaire and the first year initial data on and its predecessor the checklist for autism in toddlers chat on children aged months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low sensitivity tests many but good specificity tests few it may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish asd from other developmental disorders screening tools designed for one cultures norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture although genetic screening for autism is generally still impractical it can be considered in some cases such as children with neurological symptoms and dysmorphic features


while infection with rubella during pregnancy causes fewer than of cases of autism rubella vaccine can prevent many of those cases




the main goals when treating autistic children are to lessen associated deficits and family distress and to increase quality of life and functional independence in general higher iqs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes no single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the childs needs families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment services should be carried out by professional practice of behavior analysis special education teachers pathology and licensed psychologists studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about efficacy however the development of interventions has advanced in recent years although many psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment the methodological quality of systematic reviews of these studies has generally been poor their clinical results are mostly tentative and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options intensive sustained special education programs and behavior therapy early in life can help children acquire communication and job skills and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated while medications have not been found to help with core symptoms they may be used for associated symptoms such as irritability inattention or repetitive behavior patterns


educational interventions often used include applied behavior analysis aba developmental models structured teaching speech and language therapy social skills therapy and occupational therapy and cognitive behavioral interventions in adults without intellectual disability to reduce depression anxiety and disorder among these approaches interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit the quality of research for early intensive behavioral intervention treatment procedure incorporating over thirty hours per week of the discrete trial training that is carried out with very young currently low and more vigorous research designs with larger sample sizes are needed two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include discrete trial training and pivotal response treatment aba interventions and developmental social pragmatic models dsp one interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model which teaches parents how to implement various aba and dsp techniques allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves various dsp programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through parent implementation despite the recent development of parent training models these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment


discrete trial training has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing communication and adaptive functioning in preschool it is also for improving the intellectual performance of that age group similarly a intervention that utilizes a more pivotal response treatment combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be beneficial in improving skills in young children although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided it is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results the appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers


medications may be used to treat asd symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails they may also be used for associated health problems such as adhd or anxiety disorder more than half of us children diagnosed with asd are prescribed psychoactive drugs or anticonvulsants with the most common drug classes being antidepressants stimulants and antipsychotics the atypical antipsychotic drugs risperidone and aripiprazole are for treating associated aggressive and behaviors however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits and people with autism may respond atypically side effects for example may include weight gain tiredness drooling and aggression ssri antidepressants such as fluoxetine and fluvoxamine have been shown to be effective in reducing repetitive and ritualistic behaviors while the stimulant medication methylphenidate is beneficial for some children with inattentiveness or hyperactivity there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with asd no known medication relieves autisms core symptoms of social and communication impairments experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism


although many alternative therapies for developmental and learning disabilities are available few are supported by scientific studies treatment approaches have little empirical support in quality of life contexts and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and relevance some alternative treatments may place the child at risk the preference that children with autism have for unconventional foods can lead to reduction in bone cortical thickness with this being greater in those on diets as a consequence of the low intake of calcium and vitamin however suboptimal bone development in asd has also been associated with lack of exercise and gastrointestinal disease in botched chelation therapy killed a child with autism chelation is not recommended for people with asd since the associated risks outweigh any potential benefits another alternative medicine practice with no evidence is cease therapy a mixture of homeopathy supplements and vaccine detoxing

although popularly used as an complementary and alternative medicine for people with autism as of there is no good evidence to recommend a diet as a standard treatment a review concluded that it may be a therapeutic option for specific groups of children with autism such as those with known food intolerances or food allergy or with food intolerance markers the authors analyzed the prospective trials conducted to date that studied the efficacy of the and diet in children with asd in total all of them compared and diet versus normal diet with a control group randomized controlled trials crossover trial trial in two of the studies whose duration was and months a significant improvement in asd symptoms efficacy rate was identified in the other two studies whose duration was months no significant effect was observed the authors concluded that a longer duration of the diet may be necessary to achieve the improvement of the asd symptoms other problems documented in the trials carried out include transgressions of the diet small sample size the heterogeneity of the participants and the possibility of a placebo effect in the subset of people who have gluten sensitivity there is limited evidence that suggests that a diet may improve some autistic behaviors

results of a systematic review on interventions to address health outcomes among autistic adults found emerging evidence to support interventions for improving mental health this includes decreasing stress anxiety ruminating thoughts anger and aggression there is tentative evidence that music therapy may improve social interactions verbal communication and communication skills there has been early research looking at hyperbaric medicines in children with autism studies on pet therapy have shown positive effects


there is no known cure the degree of symptoms can decrease occasionally to the extent that people lose their diagnosis of this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not it is not known how often this outcome reported rates in unselected samples have ranged from to most autistic children acquire language by age five or younger though a few have developed communication skills in later years many autistic children lack social support future employment opportunities or theory although core difficulties tend to persist symptoms often become less severe with age

few studies address prognosis some adults show modest improvement in communication skills but a few no study has focused on autism after midlife acquiring language before age six having an iq above and having a marketable skill all predict better independent living is unlikely with severe autism

many autistic people face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood compared to the general population autistic people are more likely to be unemployed and to have never had a job about half of people in their with autism are not employed

people with autism tend to face increased stress levels related to psychosocial factors such as stigma which may increase the rates of mental health issues in the autistic population





as of reviews estimate a prevalence of per for autism and close to per for asd a survey in the united states reported a rate of per children for asd globally autism affects an estimated million people while asperger syndrome affects a further million in the national health service estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged years and over in the uk was rates of has been estimated at per asperger syndrome at roughly per and childhood disintegrative disorder at per cdc estimates about out of for an increase from out of every children for web and statistics on autism spectrum disorder cdc for disease control and prevention march november

the number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the and early this increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices referral patterns availability of services age at diagnosis and public awareness though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out the available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autisms true prevalence has a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward psychosocial factors and changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics it has been established that vaccination is not a risk factor for autism and is not behind any increase in autism prevalence rates if any change in the rate of autism exists at all

males are at higher risk for asd than females the sex ratio averages and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment it may be close to with intellectual disability and more than without several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated but the cause of the difference is one theory is that females are underdiagnosed

although the evidence does not implicate any single risk factor as a cause of autism the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent and with diabetes bleeding and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy the risk is greater with older fathers than with older two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism most professionals believe that race ethnicity and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism

several other conditions are common in children with autism they include













a few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named the table talk luther of martin luther compiled by his notetaker mathesius contains the story of a boy who may have been severely autistic the earliest case of autism is that of hugh blair of borgue as detailed in a court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul blairs marriage to gain blairs inheritance the wild boy of aveyron a feral child caught in showed several signs of the medical student jean marc gaspard itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation

the new latin word autismus english translation autism was coined by the swiss people psychiatrist eugen bleuler in as he was defining symptoms of schizophrenia he derived it from the greek word meaning self and used it to mean morbid referring to autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance the quote is a translation of bleulers original a soviet child psychiatrist grunya sukhareva described a similar syndrome that was published in russian in and in german in




the word autism first took its modern sense in when hans asperger of the vienna general hospital adopted bleulers terminology autistic psychopaths in a lecture in german about child psychology asperger was investigating an asd now known as asperger syndrome though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until leo kanner of the johns hopkins hospital first used autism in its modern sense in english when he introduced the label early infantile autism in a report of children with striking behavioral similarities reprinted in almost all the characteristics described in kanners first paper on the subject notably autistic aloneness and insistence on sameness are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders it is not known whether kanner derived the term independently of asperger

kanners reuse of autism led to decades of confused terminology like infantile schizophrenia and child psychiatrys focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infants response to refrigerator mothers starting in the late autism was established as a separate syndrome


as late as the there was little evidence of a genetic role in while in it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood asd have affected how asd is viewed parents continue to feel social stigma in situations where their childs autistic behavior is perceived negatively and many primary care physicians and medical specialists express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research

it took until for the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia in the provided a checklist for diagnosing autism in may the was released updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders the grouping of disorders including autism asperger syndrome rett syndrome and cdd has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders the two categories that exist are impaired social communication interaction and restricted repetitive behaviors

the internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find difficult to deal with and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely societal and cultural aspects of autism have developed some in the community seek a cure while others believe that neurodiversity




an autistic culture has emerged accompanied by the autistic rights and neurodiversity movements events include world autism awareness day autism sunday autistic pride day autreat and others scholars study those with autism in hopes to learn more about autism as a culture transcultural and research on social movements many autistic individuals have been successful in their fields


the autism rights movement is a social movement within the context of disability rights movements that emphasizes the concept of neurodiversity viewing the autism spectrum as a result of natural variations in the human brain rather than a disorder to be cured the autism rights movement advocates for including greater acceptance of autistic therapies that focus on coping skills rather than on imitating the behaviors of those without autism and the recognition of the autistic community as a minority group autism rights or neurodiversity advocates believe that the autism spectrum is genetic and should be accepted as a natural expression of the human genome this perspective is distinct from fringe theories that autism is caused by environmental factors such as vaccines a common criticism against autistic activists is that the majority of them are autism or have asperger syndrome and do not represent the views of autism autistic people


about half of autistics are unemployed and one third of those with graduate degrees may be unemployed among autistics who find work most are employed in sheltered settings working for wages below the national minimum while employers state hiring concerns about productivity and supervision experienced employers of autistics give positive reports of above average memory and detail orientation as well as a high regard for rules and procedure in autistic employees a majority of the economic burden of autism is caused by decreased earnings in the job market some studies also find decreased earning among parents who care for autistic children

























































































































































































albedo meaning whiteness is the measure of the diffuse reflection of sunlight out of the total solar radiation and measured on a scale from corresponding to a black body that absorbs all incident radiation to corresponding to a body that reflects all incident radiation

surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiosity radiometry to the irradiance flux per unit area received by a surface the proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the earths surface these factors vary with atmospheric composition geographic location and time see position of the sun while reflectance is calculated for a single angle of incidence ie for a given position of the sun albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period the temporal resolution may range from seconds as obtained from flux measurements to daily monthly or annual averages

unless given for a specific wavelength spectral albedo albedo refers to the entire spectrum of solar radiation due to measurement constraints it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface between and this spectrum includes visible spectrum which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark eg trees absorb most radiation whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright eg snow reflects most radiation

albedo is an important concept in climatology astronomy and environmental management eg as part of the leadership in energy and environmental design program for sustainable rating of the average albedo of the earth from the upper atmosphere its planetary albedo is because of cloud cover but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features

the term albedo was introduced into optics by johann heinrich lambert in his work photometria

























































any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about for fresh snow to about for charcoal one of the darkest substances deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a black body when seen from a distance the ocean surface has a low albedo as do most forests whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms most land areas are in an albedo range of to the average albedo of earth is about this is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds


earths surface albedo is regularly estimated via earth observation satellite sensors such as nasas modis instruments on board the terra satellite and aqua satellite satellites and the ceres instrument on the suomi npp and joint polar satellite system as the amount of reflected radiation is only measured for a single direction by satellite not all directions a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of reflectance and reflectance eg these calculations are based on the bidirectional reflectance distribution function brdf which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle bdrf can facilitate translations of observations of reflectance into albedo

earths average surface temperature due to its albedo and the greenhouse effect is currently about if earth were frozen entirely and hence be more reflective the average temperature of the planet would drop below if only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about in contrast if the entire earth was covered by water a ocean planet the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost


for land surfaces it has been shown that the albedo at a particular solar zenith angle can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms


with being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle and being the proportion of diffuse illumination the actual albedo also called albedo can then be given as



this formula is important because it allows the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface



the albedos of planets natural satellite and minor planets such as asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties the study of albedos their dependence on wavelength lighting angle phase angle and variation in time composes a major part of the astronomical field of photometry astronomy for small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos for example the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer solar system objects the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about regolith properties whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in asteroids

enceladus a moon of saturn has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the solar system with an albedo of another notable body is eris dwarf planet with an albedo of

















































the overall albedo of the moon is measured to be around











but it is strongly directional and reflectance displaying also a strong opposition effect although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains they are typical of the regolith surfaces of airless solar system bodies

two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the geometric albedo measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer and the bond albedo measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected their values can differ significantly which is a common source of confusion








































in detailed studies the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five hapke parameters which describe the variation of albedo with phase angle astronomy including a characterization of the opposition effect of regolith surfaces

the correlation between astronomical geometric albedo absolute magnitude for planets h and diameter web











where a is the astronomical albedo d is the diameter in kilometers and h is the absolute magnitude




albedo is not directly dependent on illumination because changing the amount of incoming light proportionally changes the amount of reflected light except in circumstances where a change in illumination induces a change in the earths surface at that location eg through melting of reflective ice that said albedo and illumination both vary by latitude albedo is highest near the poles and lowest in the subtropics with a local maximum in the tropics


the intensity of albedo temperature effects depends on the amount of albedo and the level of local insolation solar high albedo areas in the arctic and antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation whereas areas such as the sahara desert which also have a relatively high albedo will be hotter due to high insolation tropical and rainforest areas have low albedo and are much hotter than their temperate forest counterparts which have lower insolation because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes

arctic regions notably release more heat back into space than what they absorb effectively cooling the earth this has been a concern since arctic ice and snow has been melting at higher rates due to higher temperatures creating regions in the arctic that are notably darker being water or ground which is darker color and reflects less heat back into space this feedback results in a reduced albedo effect


albedo affects climate by determining how much radiation a planet absorbs the uneven heating of earth from albedo variations between land ice or ocean surfaces can drive weather


when an areas albedo changes due to snowfall a feedback results a layer of snowfall increases local albedo reflecting away sunlight leading to local cooling in principle if no outside temperature change affects this area eg a warm air mass the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall deepening the feedback however because local weather is dynamic due to the change of seasons eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight higher insolation cause melting when the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo such as grass soil or ocean the effect is reversed the darkening surface lowers albedo increasing local temperatures which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further resulting in still more heating


snow albedo is highly variable ranging from as high as for freshly fallen snow to about for melting snow and as low as for dirty snowhall dk and martinec j remote sensing of ice and snow chapman and hall new york pp over antarctica snow albedo averages a little more than if a marginally area warms snow tends to melt lowering the albedo and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack the positive feedback

just as fresh snow has a higher albedo than does dirty snow the albedo of sea ice is far higher than that of sea water sea water absorbs more solar radiation than would the same surface covered with reflective snow when sea ice melts either due to a rise in sea temperature or in response to increased solar radiation from above the surface is reduced and more surface of sea water is exposed so the rate of energy absorption increases the extra absorbed energy heats the sea water which in turn increases the rate at which sea ice melts as with the preceding example of snowmelt the process of melting of sea ice is thus another example of a positive feedbackall about sea ice national snow and ice data center accessed november both positive feedback loops have long been recognized as important for global warming

cryoconite powdery windblown dust containing soot sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets changing greenland melt zone page of article by mark jenkins in national geographic magazine june accessed july

the dynamical nature of albedo in response to positive feedback together with the effects of small errors in the measurement of albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates because of this in order to reduce the error of energy estimates it is important to measure the albedo of areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value for albedo over broad regions


albedo works on a smaller scale too in sunlight dark clothes absorb more heat and clothes reflect it better thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing


albedo can affect the electrical energy output of solar photovoltaic system for example the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon and crystalline silicon compared to traditional albedo predictions research showed impacts of over more recently the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of commonly occurring surface materials both and natural and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies industrial solar farms commercial flat rooftops and residential applications


because forests generally have a low albedo the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through photosynthesis some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation in the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through evapotranspiration the water vapor causes cooling on the land surface causes heating where it condenses acts a strong greenhouse gas and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate

in seasonally zones winter albedos of treeless areas are to higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily deciduous trees have an albedo value of about to whereas coniferous trees have a value of about to variation in summer albedo across both forest types is correlated with maximum rates of photosynthesis because plants with high growth capacity display a greater fraction of their foliage for direct interception of incoming radiation in the upper journal


















































studies by the hadley centre have investigated the relative generally warming effect of albedo change and cooling effect of carbon sequestration on planting forests they found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to new forests in high latitudes eg siberia were neutral or perhaps warming



water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials the reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the fresnel equations

at the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally specular reflection not diffuse reflection the glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this at small angle of incidence optics light waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the curve and a locally increased average incident angle

although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of earth near the terminator solar early morning late afternoon and near the poles however as mentioned above waviness causes an appreciable reduction because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light

note that white caps on waves look white and have high albedo because the water is foamed up so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect adding up their reflectivities fresh black ice exhibits fresnel reflection
snow on top of this sea ice increases the albedo to


cloud albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near to a maximum approaching on any given day about half of earth is covered by clouds which reflect more sunlight than land and water clouds keep earth cool by reflecting sunlight but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth

albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds such as those created by the contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic a study following the burning of the kuwaiti oil fields during iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies


aerosols very fine in the atmosphere have both direct and indirect effects on earths radiative balance the direct albedo effect is generally to cool the the indirect effect the particles act as cloud condensation nuclei and thereby change cloud properties is less certain as per spracklen et al the effects are







another effect on the climate is from black carbon particles the size of this effect is difficult to quantify the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is w with a range to w black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedojames hansen larissa nazarenko soot climate forcing via snow and ice albedos proc of the natl acad of sci january the efficacy of this forcing is for a given forcing it is twice as effective as in altering global surface air compare zender testimony supra note at figure see j hansen l nazarenko supra note at the efficacy for changes of arctic sea ice albedo is in additional runs not shown here we found that the efficacy of albedo changes in antarctica is also see also flanner mg cs zender jt randerson and pj rasch climate forcing and response from black carbon in snow j geophys res the forcing is maximum coincidentally with snowmelt onset triggering strong feedback in local springtime consequently the efficacy of black forcing is more than three times greater than forcing by


human activities eg deforestation farming and urbanization change the albedo of various areas around the globe however quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult further study is required to determine anthropogenic effects


albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles it depends on properties of the material refractive the size of the particle or and the wavelength of the incoming radiation



























































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































a or a is the first letter alphabet and the first vowel letter of the english alphabet and the iso basic latin alphabet its name in english is english names pronounced plural english is the plural of the name of the letter the plural of the letter itself is rendered as as as or it is similar in shape to the alpha from which it derives the letter case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar the lowercase version can be written in two forms the a and the latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it especially fonts intended to be read by children and is also found in italic type

in the english grammar english articles and its variant english article are article article
















































the earliest certain ancestor of a is aleph also written aleph the first letter of the phoenician alphabet which consisted entirely of consonants for that reason it is also called an abjad to distinguish it from a true alphabet in turn the ancestor of aleph may have been a pictogram of an ox head in script influenced by egyptian hieroglyphs styled as a triangular head with two horns extended











when the ancient greece adopted the alphabet they had no use for a letter to represent the glottal consonant sound that the letter denoted in phoenician language and other semitic languages and that was the first phoneme of the phoenician pronunciation of the they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel and called it by the similar name of alpha in the earliest greek inscriptions after the greek dark ages dating to the century bc the letter rests upon its side but in the greek alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg or by the angle at which the cross line is set

the etruscan civilization brought the greek alphabet to their civilization in the italian peninsula and left the letter unchanged the romans later adopted the old italic script to write the latin and the resulting letter was preserved in the latin script that would come to be used to write many languages including english



during roman times there were many variant forms of the letter a first was the monumental or lapidary style which was used when inscribing on stone or other permanent media there was also a cursive style used for everyday or utilitarian writing which was done on more perishable surfaces due to the perishable nature of these surfaces there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive such as letter case cursive letter case cursive and semicursive minuscule variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles the known variants include the early uncial the uncial and the later


at the end of the roman empire century ad several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through western europe among these were the semicursive minuscule of italy the merovingian script in france the visigothic script in spain and the insular script or or majuscule of great britain by the century the carolingian minuscule which was very similar to the form was the principal form used in before the advent of the printing press this form was derived through a combining of prior forms

italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today these variants the italic and roman forms were derived from the caroline script version the italic form also called script a is used in most current handwriting and consists of a circle and vertical stroke this slowly developed from the form resembling the greek letter tau in the hands of medieval irish and english writers the roman form is used in most printed it consists of a small loop with an arc over it a both derive from the majuscule capital form in greek handwriting it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop as demonstrated by the uncial version shown many fonts then made the right leg vertical in some of these the serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc resulting in the printed form while in others it was dropped resulting in the modern handwritten form graphic designers refer to the italic and roman forms as single decker a and double decker a respectively

italic type is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest set in roman type there are some other cases aside from italic type where script a also called latin alpha is used in contrast with latin a such as in the international phonetic alphabet





in modern english orthography the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds








the double sequence does not occur in native english words but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as aaron and aardvark however occurs in list of digraphs all with their own sound or sounds particularly and




in most languages that use the latin alphabet denotes an open unrounded vowel such as or an exception is saanich dialect in which and the glyph stands for a front unrounded vowel









in algebra the letter a along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet x y z are used to denote unknown quantities

in geometry capital a b c etc are used to denote line segments line geometrys line etc a capital a is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a triangle the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle a

a is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status a or the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students a grade for clean celebrities etc such associations can have a motivation effect as exposure to the letter a has been found to improve performance when compared with other letters

a is used as a prefix on some words such as asymmetry to mean not or without from greek

in english grammar a and its variant an is an article article used to introduce noun phrases

finally the letter a is used to denote size as in a narrow size shoe or a small cup size in a brassiere















































































































































































































































































































































































alabama is a state in the southeastern united states region of the united states bordered by tennessee to the georgia us state to the florida and the gulf of mexico to the and mississippi to the west alabama is the list of us states and territories by area and the list of us states and territories by population of the list of us states with a total of of inland waterways alabama has among the most of any state

alabama is nicknamed the northern flicker state after the list of us state birds alabama is also known as the heart of dixie and the cotton state the list of us state trees is the longleaf pine and the list of us state flowers is the camellia alabamas capital is montgomery alabama the largest city by population is birmingham alabama which has long been the most industrialized the largest city is huntsville alabama the oldest city is mobile alabama founded by french colonists in as the capital of louisiana new france birmingham metropolitan area alabama is alabamas largest urban economy its most populous urban area and its economic center

the states geography is diverse with the north dominated by the mountainous tennessee valley and the south by mobile bay a historically significant port politically as part of the deep south alabama is now a predominantly conservative state and it is known for its southern culture today american football particularly at the college level at schools like the university of alabama auburn university and jacksonville state university is a major part of the states culture

originally home to many native tribes alabama was a spanish territory beginning in the sixteenth century until the french acquired it in the early eighteenth century founding mobile in the british won the territory in until losing it in the american revolutionary war spain held mobile as part of spanish west florida until spain ceded west florida to the us in in december alabama was recognized as a state during the antebellum period alabama was a major cotton producer and widely used slaves on its plantations in the state seceded from the united states to become part of the confederate states of america with montgomery acting as its first capital and rejoined the union in

from the american civil war until world war ii alabama like many states in the southern us suffered economic hardship in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture similar to other former slave states alabamian legislators employed jim crow laws to disenfranchise and otherwise discriminate against african americans from the end of the reconstruction era up until at least the despite the growth of major industries and urban centers white american rural interests dominated the state legislature from to the during this time urban interests and african americans were markedly events such as the selma to montgomery march made the state a major focal point of the civil rights movement in the and following world war ii alabama grew as the states economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests the states economy in the century is based on management automotive finance manufacturing aerospace mineral extraction healthcare education retail and technology


the naming of the alabama river and state was derived from the alabama people a muskogean languages whose members lived just below the confluence of the coosa river and tallapoosa river rivers on the upper reaches of the river in the alabama language the word for a person of alabama lineage is albaamo or variously albaama or in different the plural form is albaamaha the suggestion that alabama was borrowed from the choctaw language is unlikely alabama n and adj oxford english dictionary online march oxford university press accessed april the words spelling varies significantly among historical sources the first usage appears in three accounts of the hernando de soto expedition of garcilaso de la vega chronicler used alibamo while the knight of elvas and rodrigo ranjel wrote alibamu and limamu respectively in transliterations of the term as early as the french called the tribe the alibamon with french maps identifying the river as des alibamons other spellings of the name have included alibamu alabamo albama alebamon alibama alibamou alabamu allibamouand possibly alabahmu the use of state names derived from indigenous languages of the americas is common in the an estimated states have names of native american origin

sources disagree on the words meaning some scholars suggest the word comes from the choctaw alba meaning plants or weeds and amo meaning to cut to trim or to gather the meaning may have been clearers of the thicket or herb gatherers referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants the state has numerous list of place names in alabama of native american origin however there are no correspondingly similar words in the alabama language

an article in the jacksonville republican proposed it meant here we rest this notion was popularized in the through the writings of alexander beaufort meek experts in the muskogean languages have not found any evidence to support such a translation







indigenous peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of european colonization trade with the northeastern tribes by the ohio river began during the burial mound period and continued until european colonization of the americas

the agrarian mississippian culture covered most of the state from to ce with one of its major centers built at what is now the moundville archaeological site in moundville alabama this is the complex of the classic middle mississippian era after cahokia in illinois which was the center of the culture analysis of artifact archaeology from archaeological excavations at moundville were the basis of scholars formulating the characteristics of the southeastern ceremonial complex secc contrary to popular belief the secc appears to have no direct links to mesoamerican culture but developed independently the ceremonial complex represents a major component of the religion of the mississippian it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood

among the historical tribes of native american people living in alabama at the time of european contact were the cherokee an iroquoian language and the alabama people alibamu chickasaw choctaw creek people and koasati while part of the same large language family the muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages




the spanish were the first europeans to reach alabama during their exploration of north america in the century the expedition of hernando de soto passed through mabila and other parts of the state in more than years later the french founded the regions first european settlement at old mobile site in the city was moved to the current site of mobile alabama in this area was claimed by the french from to as part of la louisiane

after the french lost to the british in the seven years war it became part of british west florida from to after the united states victory in the american revolutionary war the territory was divided between the united states and spain the latter retained control of this western territory from until the surrender of the spanish garrison at mobile to us forces on april

thomas bassett a loyalist american revolution to the british monarchy during the revolutionary era was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside mobile he settled in the tombigbee district during the early the districts boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the tombigbee river and included portions of what is today southern clarke county alabama northernmost mobile county alabama and most of washington county alabama

what is now the counties of baldwin county alabama and mobile county alabama became part of spanish west florida in part of the independent republic of west florida in and was finally added to the mississippi territory in most of what is now the northern of alabama was known as the yazoo lands beginning during the british colonial period it was claimed by the province of georgia from onwards following the revolutionary war it remained a part of georgia us state although heavily disputed

with the exception of the area around mobile and the yazoo lands what is now the lower of alabama was made part of the mississippi territory when it was organized in the yazoo lands were added to the territory in following the yazoo land scandal spain kept a claim on its former spanish west florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the treaty officially ceded it to the united states in





before mississippis admission to statehood on december the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the alabama territory the united states congress created the alabama territory on march st stephens alabama now abandoned served as the territorial capital from to

alabama was admitted as the state on december with congress selecting huntsville as the site for the first constitutional convention from to august delegates met to prepare the new state constitution huntsville served as temporary capital from to when the seat of government moved to cahaba alabama in dallas county alabama

cahaba now a ghost town was the first permanent state capital from to the alabama fever land rush was underway when the state was admitted to the union with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation part of the frontier in the and its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men


southeastern planters and traders from the upper south brought history of slavery in alabama with them as the cotton list of plantations in alabama expanded the economy of the central black belt region of alabama named for its dark productive soil was built around large cotton plantation complexes in the southeastern united states whose owners wealth grew mainly from slave labor the area also drew many poor disenfranchised people who became subsistence farmers alabama had an estimated population of under people in but it increased to more than people by most native american tribes were indian removal from the state within a few years of the passage of the indian removal act by congress in

from to tuscaloosa alabama served as alabamas capital on january the alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from tuscaloosa to montgomery alabama the first legislative session in the new capital met in december a new capitol building was erected under the direction of stephen decatur button of philadelphia the first structure burned down in but was rebuilt on the same site in this second capitol building in montgomery remains to the present day it was designed by barachias holt of exeter maine




by the population had increased to people of which nearly half were enslaved african americans and were free people of color on january alabama declared its secession in the united states from the union american civil war after remaining an independent republic for a few days it joined the confederate states of america the confederacys capital was initially at montgomery alabama alabama was heavily alabama in the american civil war although comparatively few battles were fought in the state alabama contributed about soldiers to the war effort


a company of cavalry soldiers from huntsville alabama joined nathan bedford forrests battalion in hopkinsville kentucky the company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves collar and coat tails this led to them being greeted with yellowhammer and the name later was applied to all alabama troops in the confederate army official symbols and emblems of alabama state bird of alabama yellowhammer alabama state archives

alabamas slaves were freed by the amendment in alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in may until its official restoration to the union in from to with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised many african americans emerged as political leaders in the state alabama was represented in congress during this period by three congressmen jeremiah haralson benjamin s turner and james t rapier

following the war the state remained chiefly agricultural with an economy tied to cotton during reconstruction era state legislators ratified a constitution of alabama in which created the states first public school system and expanded womens rights legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation organized insurgent resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and republicans besides the original ku klux klan these included the pale faces knights of the white camellia red shirts southern united states and the white league

reconstruction in alabama ended in when the democrats regained control of the legislature and governors office through an election dominated by fraud and violence they wrote another constitution in and the legislature passed the blaine amendment prohibiting public money from being used to finance schools the same year legislation was approved that called for racial segregation schools railroad passenger cars were segregated in after disenfranchising most african americans and many poor whites in the constitution the alabama legislature passed more jim crow laws at the beginning of the century to impose segregation in everyday life




the new constitution of alabama included provisions for voter registration that effectively disfranchisement after the reconstruction era large portions of the population including nearly all african americans and native americans and tens of thousands of poor whites through making voter registration difficult requiring a poll tax united states and literacy testmorgan kousser the shaping of southern politics suffrage restriction and the establishment of the south new haven yale university press the constitution required racial segregation of public schools by only african americans were registered in alabama although at least were literate this compared to more than african americans eligible to vote in the numbers dropped even more in later decades the state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the jails were segregated in hospitals in toilets hotels and restaurants in and bus stop waiting rooms in

while the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax by whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws whites vs feldman the disfranchisement myth poor whites and suffrage restriction in alabama athens university of georgia press p nearly all african americans had lost the ability to vote despite numerous legal challenges which succeeded in overturning certain provisions the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement the exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens

the alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised african americans but it did not relieve them of paying taxes partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for african americans in the south the rosenwald fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as rosenwald schools in alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with rosenwald funds which paid of the construction costs the fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest black residents effectively taxed themselves twice by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools which were built in many rural areas they often donated land and labor as web rosenwald school building fund and associated buildings mps register information system


beginning in the first rosenwald schools were built in alabama for children a total of schools seven teachers houses and several vocational buildings were completed by in the state several of the the rosenwald school building fund and associated buildings multiple property submission in the state are now listed on the national register of historic places

continued racial discrimination and lynchings agricultural depression and the failure of the cotton crops due to boll weevil infestation led tens of thousands of african americans from rural alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the century as part of the great migration african american out of the news migration britannica reflecting this emigration the population growth rate in alabama see historical populations table below dropped by nearly half from to

at the same time many rural people migrated to the city of birmingham alabama to work in new industrial jobs birmingham experienced such rapid growth it was called the magic web encyclopedia of alabama of by birmingham was the city in the united states heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy its residents were for decades in the state legislature which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes as it was required by the state constitution this did not change until the late following a lawsuit and court order


industrial development related to the demands of world war ii brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living one example of this massive influx of workers occurred in mobile between and more than people moved into the city to work for industries cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base

despite massive population changes in the state from to the legislature refused to reapportion house and senate seats based on population as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses they held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas one result was that jefferson county alabama containing birminghams industrial and economic powerhouse contributed more than of all tax revenue to the state but did not receive a proportional amount in services urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature a study noted that because of rural domination a minority of about of the total state population is in majority control of the alabama legislature

in the united states supreme court cases of baker v carr and reynolds v sims the court ruled that the principle of one man one vote needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures and that their districts had to be based on population rather than geographic counties

in for the first time since the legislature completed the congressional redistricting based on the decennial census this benefited the urban areas that had developed as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than sixty years other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts

african americans continued to press in the and to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the civil rights movement including legal challenges in the us supreme court ruled in brown v board of education that public schools had to be desegregated but alabama was slow to comply during the under governor george wallace alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for desegregation the civil rights movement had notable events in alabama including the montgomery bus boycott freedom rides in and selma to montgomery marches these contributed to congressional passage and enactment of the civil rights act of and voting rights act of by the us congress

legal segregation ended in the states in but jim crow customs often continued until specifically challenged in court according to the new york times by many of alabamas were living in alabamas cities such as birmingham and montgomery also the black belt region of alabama across central alabama is home to largely poor counties that are predominantly these counties include dallas county alabama lowndes county alabama marengo county alabama and perry county alabama

alabama has made some changes since the late century and has used new types of voting to increase representation in the an omnibus redistricting case dillard v crenshaw county challenged the voting for representative seats of alabama jurisdictions including counties and school boards voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county as the majority tended to take all seats despite african americans making up a significant minority in the state they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the jurisdictions

as part of settlement of this case five alabama cities and counties including chilton county alabama adopted a system of proportional representation for election of representatives in jurisdictions this has resulted in more proportional representation for voters in another form of proportional representation jurisdictions use limited voting as in conecuh county alabama in limited voting was first tested in conecuh county alabama together use of these systems has increased the number of african americans and women being elected to local offices resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens cumulative elections in alabama voting in alabama fairvote archives accessed january

beginning in the the states economy shifted away from its traditional lumber steel and textile industries because of increased foreign competition steel jobs for instance declined from in to in however the state particularly huntsville benefited from the opening of the george c marshall space flight center in a major facility in the development of the saturn rocket program and the space shuttle technology and manufacturing industries such as automobile assembly replaced some the states older industries in the late twentieth century but the states economy and growth lagged behind other states in the area such as georgia and florida



in alabama supreme court chief justice roy moore installed a statue of the ten commandments in the capitol in montgomery in the us circuit court ordered the statue removed but moore refused to follow the court order which led to protests around the capitol in favor of keeping the monument the monument was removed in august

in greek mythology achilles or achilleus was a hero of the trojan war the greatest of all the greek warriors and is the central character of homers iliad he was the son of the nereid thetis and peleus king of phthia

achilles most notable feat during the trojan war was the slaying of the trojan prince hector outside the gates of troy although the death of achilles is not presented in the iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the trojan war by paris mythology who shot him in the heel with an arrow later legends beginning with statius unfinished epic achilleid written in the century ad state that achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel because when his mother thetis dipped him in the river styx as an infant she held him by one of his heels alluding to these legends the term achilles heel has come to mean a point of weakness especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution the achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends



linear b tablets attest to the personal name achilleus in the forms and accessed may the latter being the dative case of the former the name grew more popular even becoming common soon after the seventh century bc epigraphical database gives matches for earliest ones corinth c bc delphi bc attica and elis c bc and was also turned into the female form attested in attica in the fourth century bc inscriptiones graecae and in the form achillia on a female as the name of a female gladiator fighting an amazon

achilles name can be analyzed as a combination of distress pain sorrow griefscholia to the iliad and people soldiers nation resulting in a he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress the grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the iliad and frequently by achilles himself achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of glory usually in war furthermore has been construed by gregory nagy following leonard palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster military with this derivation the name obtains a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war the poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership



another etymology relates the name to a compound linguistics sharp foot which first gave an illyrian languages evolving through time into and then the shift from to is then ascribed to the passing of the name into greek via a source the first root part sharp pointed also gave greek point silence healing point edge zenith and sharp pointed keen quick clever whereas stems from the root to be upset afraid the whole expression would be comparable to the latin acupedius swift of foot compare also the latin word family of sharp edge or point battle line battle engagement acus needle pin bodkin and to make pointed sharpen to to arouse whence acutecf the wiktionary entries and some literary topos epitheta of achilles in the iliad point to this namely divine achillesiliad or even more frequently achillese g iliad

some researchers deem the name a loan word possibly from a language achilles descent from the nereid thetis and a similarity of his name with those of potamoi such as acheron and achelous have led to speculations about him being an old greek sea gods see below the supportive position of a critical point of view is taken by robert s p beekes has suggested a origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of and in epic language which may account for a palatalized phoneme in the original languagerobert s p beekes etymological dictionary of greek brill pp



achilles was the son of the thetis a nereid and peleus the king of the myrmidons zeus and poseidon had been rivals for thetiss hand in marriage until prometheus the warned zeus of a prophecy originally uttered by themis goddess of divine law that thetis would bear a son greater than his father for this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed peleusaeschylus prometheus bound pindar nemean isthmian bibliotheca poeticon astronomicon

there is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events in the argonautica zeus sister and wife hera alludes to thetis chaste resistance to the advances of zeus pointing out that thetis was so loyal to heras marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods thetis although a daughter of the nereus was also brought up by hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of zeus zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an bibliotheca



according to the achilleid written by statius in the century ad and to lost works when achilles was born thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heelstatius achilleid hyginus fabulae see achilles heel achilles tendon it is not clear if this version of events was known earlier in another version of this story thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body she was interrupted by peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rageapollonius of rhodes argonautica

none of the sources before statius make any reference to this general invulnerability to the contrary in the iliad homer mentions achilles being wounded in book the paeonian hero asteropaeus son of pelagon challenged achilles by the river scamander he was ambidextrous and cast a spear from each one grazed achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood


in the few fragmentary poems of the epic cycle which describe the heros death ie the cypria the little iliad by lesches of pyrrha the aithiopis and iliou persis by arctinus of miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel in the later vase paintings presenting the death of achilles the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his torso

peleus entrusted achilles to chiron the centaur who lived on mount pelion to be rearedhesiod catalogue of women fr iliad thetis foretold that her sons fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the trojan wariliad according to homer achilles grew up in phthia with his companion patroclus

according to photius the sixth book of the new history by ptolemy hephaestion reported that thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by peleus when she had achilles peleus noticed tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to the centaur chiron later chiron exhumed the body of the damysus giant who was the fastest of all the giants removed the ankle and incorporated it into achilles burnt foot photius bibliotheca cod thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by six were when she had achilles peleus noticed and tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to chiron the latter exhumed the body of the giant damysos who was buried at was the fastest of all the the astragale and incorporated it into achilles foot using ingredients this astragale fell when achilles was pursued by apollo and it was thus that achilles fallen was killed it is said on the other hand that he was called podarkes by the poet because it is said thetis gave the newborn child the wings of arce and podarkes means that his feet had the wings of arce


among the appellations under which achilles is generally known are the following











it is said that he akhilleus achilles was called podarkes podarces by the poet ie homer because it is said thetis gave the newborn child the wings of arke arce and podarkes means that his feet had the wings of arke and arke was the daughter of thaumas and her sister was both had wings but during the struggle of the gods against the titanes titans arke flew out of the camp of the gods and joined the titanes after the victory zeus removed her wings before throwing her into tartaros and when he came to the wedding of peleus and thetis he brought these wings as a gift for thetis




some sourceseuripides skyrioi surviving only in fragmentary philostratus iii imagines scholiast on homers iliad ovid metamorphoses ovid tristia mentioning a roman tragedy on this bibliotheca statius achilleid claim that in order to keep achilles safe from the war thetis or in some versions peleus hid the young man at the court of lycomedes king of skyros

there achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name pyrrha the girl with lycomedes daughter deidamia mythology whom in the account of statius he raped achilles there fathered two sons neoptolemus also called pyrrhus after his fathers possible alias and oneiros according to this story odysseus learned from the prophet calchas that the achaeans would be unable to capture troy without achilles aid odysseus went to skyros in the guise of a peddler selling womens clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods when achilles instantly took up the spear odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the greek campaign in another version of the story odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with lycomedes women while the women fled in panic achilles prepared to defend the court thus giving his identity away





according to the iliad achilles arrived at troy with ships each carrying myrmidons he appointed five leaders each leader commanding myrmidons menesthius eudoros peisander phoenix son of amyntor and alcimedoniliad


when the greeks left for the trojan war they accidentally stopped in mysia ruled by king telephus in the resulting battle achilles gave telephus a wound that would not telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal guided by the oracle he arrived at argos peloponnese where achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to troy

according to other reports in euripides lost works about telephus he went to aulis ancient greece pretending to be a beggar and asked achilles to heal his wound achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge alternatively telephus held orestes mythology for ransom the ransom being achilles aid in healing the wound odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the therefore the spear must be able to heal it pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and telephus was healed





according to the cypria the part of the epic cycle that tells the events of the trojan war before achilles wrath when the achaeans homer desired to return home they were restrained by achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of aeneas sacked neighbouring cities like pedasus and lyrnessus where the greeks capture the queen briseis and killed tenes a son of apollo as well as priams son troilus in the sanctuary of apollo however the romance between troilus and chryseis described in geoffrey chaucers troilus and criseyde and in william shakespeares troilus and cressida is a medieval invention

homers iliad is the most famous narrative of achilles deeds in the trojan war achilles wrath is the central theme of the poem the first two lines of the iliad read





the accursed rage that brought great suffering to the achaeans


the homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war and does not narrate achilles death it begins with achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by agamemnon the commander of the achaeans homer forces agamemnon has taken a woman named chryseis as his slave her father chryses a priest of apollo begs agamemnon to return her to him agamemnon refuses and apollo sends a plague amongst the greeks the prophet calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless achilles vows to protect him achilles does so and calchas declares that chryseis must be returned to her father agamemnon consents but then commands that achilles battle prize briseis the daughter of briseus be brought to him to replace chryseis angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later because he loves briseisiliad with the urging of his mother thetis achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other greek forces at the same time burning with rage over agamemnons theft achilles homeric prayer to thetis to convince zeus to help the trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honour

as the battle turns against the greeks thanks to the influence of zeus nestor mythology declares that the trojans are winning because agamemnon has angered achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior agamemnon agrees and sends odysseus and two other chieftains ajax the great and phoenix son of amyntor they promise that if achilles returns to battle agamemnon will return the captive briseis and other gifts achilles rejects all agamemnon offers him and simply urges the greeks to sail home as he was planning to do



the trojans led by hector subsequently push the greek army back toward the beaches and assault the greek ships with the greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction patroclus leads the myrmidons into battle wearing achilles armour though achilles remains at his camp patroclus succeeds in pushing the trojans back from the beaches but is killed by hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of troy

after receiving the news of the death of patroclus from antilochus the son of nestor achilles grieves over his beloved companions death his mother thetis comes to comfort the distraught achilles she persuades hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that patroclus had been wearing which was taken by hector the new armour includes the shield of achilles described in great detail in the poem

enraged over the death of patroclus achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out hector achilles even engages in battle with the river god scamander who has become angry that achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed the god tries to drown achilles but is stopped by hera and hephaestus zeus himself takes note of achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of achilles can defy fate itself finally achilles finds his prey achilles chases hector around the wall of troy three times before athena in the form of hectors favorite and dearest brother deiphobus persuades hector to stop running and fight achilles face to face after hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable wanting to go down fighting he charges at achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses accepting his fate hector begs achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him achilles tells hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw such agonies you have caused methe iliad fagles translation penguin books achilles then kills hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot after having a dream where patroclus begs achilles to hold his funeral achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion

at the onset of his duel with hector achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky which comes on in the autumn orions dog a sign of evil during the cremation of patroclus he is compared to hesperus the star venus while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until phosphorus morning star the star also venus has set descended

with the assistance of the god hermes argeiphontes hectors father priam goes to achilles tent to plead with achilles for the return of hectors body so that he can be buried achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral lasting days with a burial on the in the tradition of niobes offspring the poem ends with a description of hectors funeral with the doom of troy and achilles himself still to come





the aethiopis century bc and a work named posthomerica composed by quintus of smyrna in the fourth century ce relate further events from the trojan war when penthesilea queen of the amazons and daughter of ares arrives in troy priam hopes that she will defeat achilles after his temporary truce with priam achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death laterpropertius quintus smyrnaeus at first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her

following the death of patroclus nestors son antilochus becomes achilles closest companion when memnon mythology son of the dawn goddess eos and king of ethiopia mythology slays antilochus achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing memnon consequently eos will not let the sun rise until zeus persuades her the fight between achilles and memnon over antilochus echoes that of achilles and hector over patroclus except that memnon unlike hector was also the son of a goddess

many homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the description of the death of patroclus and achilles reaction to it the episode then formed the basis of the epic cycle aethiopis which was composed after the iliad possibly in the century bc the aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors






the exact nature of achilles relationship with patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times in the iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship homer does not suggest that achilles and his close friend patroclus had sexual relations although there is no direct evidence in the text of the iliad that achilles and patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures in bce athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the pederasty in ancient greece in platos symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that achilles and patroclus were a phaedrus argues that achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and patroclus was the loverplato symposium plato the beauty of achilles was a topic already broached at iliad however ancient greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexualkenneth dover greek homosexuality harvard university press p et passim and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to achilles and patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship




the death of achilles even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources is a complex one with many different versionsabrantes c in the oldest version the iliad and as predicted by hector with his dying breath the heros death was brought about by paris mythology with an arrow to the heel according to statius in some versions the god apollo guided paris arrow some retellings also state that achilles was scaling the gates of troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow all of these versions deny paris any sort of valour owing to the common conception that paris was a coward and not the man his brother hector was and achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield

after death achilles bones were mingled with those of patroclus and funeral games were held he was represented in the aethiopis as living after his death in the island of leuke at the mouth of the river danube



another version of achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the trojan princesses polyxena achilles asks priam for polyxenas hand in marriage priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the worlds greatest warrior but while priam is overseeing the private marriage of polyxena and achilles paris who would have to give up helen if achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots achilles with a divine arrow killing him

in the odyssey agamemnon informs achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors of penelope in hadesodyssey he claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of patrocluse hamilton mythology new york penguin books paris was later killed by philoctetes using the enormous bow of heracles

in book of homers odyssey odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades one of these is achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead but achilles then asks odysseus of his sons exploits in the trojan war and when odysseus tells of neoptolemus heroic actions achilles is filled with satisfactionodyssey this leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how achilles felt about the heroic life

according to some accounts he had married medea in life so that after both their deaths they were united in the elysium of as hera promised thetis in apollonius of rhodes argonautica century bc





achilles armour was the object of a feud between odysseus and ajax the great ajax the greater they competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after achilles to their trojan prisoners who after considering both mens presentations decided odysseus was more deserving of the armour furious ajax cursed odysseus which earned him the ire of athena who temporarily made ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades after a while when athena lifted his madness and ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep he was so ashamed that he committed suicide odysseus eventually gave the armour to neoptolemus the son of achilles when odysseus encounters the shade of ajax much later in the house of hades odyssey ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to odysseus

a relic claimed to be achilles spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of athena on the acropolis of phaselis lycia a port on the pamphylian gulf the city was visited in bce by alexander the great who envisioned himself as the new achilles and carried the iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the however it was shown in the time of pausanias geographer in the century cealexander came to rest at phaselis a coastal city which was later renowned for the possession of achilles original spear robin lane fox alexander the great p see christian jacob and anne the greek travelers areas of knowledge myths and other discourses in pausanias description of greece yale french studies rethinking history time myth and writing especially

the tomb of achillescf homer iliad extant throughout antiquity in troadherodotus histories herodotus pliny naturalis historia strabo geographica diogenes was venerated by thessalians but also by persians expeditionary forces as well as by alexander the great and the roman emperor caracalla achilles cult was also to be found at other places e g on the island of astypalaea in the sporadescicero de natura deorum in sparta which had a sanctuarypausanias description of greece in elis and in achilles homeland thessaly as well as in the magna graecia cities of taranto locri and crotonelycophron accounting for an almost panhellenic cult to the hero

the cult of achilles is illustrated in the bce polyxena sarcophagus which depicts the sacrifice of polyxena near the tumulus of achilles strabo also suggested that such a cult of achilles existed in troad



the spread and intensity of the heros veneration among the greeks in crimea that had second greek colonisation on the northern coast of the pontus euxinus todays black sea appears to have been remarkable an archaic cult is attested for the miletus colony of olbia archaeological site as well as for an island in the middle of the black sea today identified with snake island black sea ukrainian language zmiinyi near kiliya ukraine early dedicatory inscriptions from the greek colonies on the black sea graffiti and inscribed clay disks these possibly being votive offerings from olbia the area of berezan island and the tauric chersonese attest the existence of a heroic cult of achilles from the sixth century bc onwards the cult was still thriving in the third century ce when dedicatory stelae from olbia refer to an achilles roughly lord of the sea or of the pontus euxinus who was invoked as a protector of the city of olbia venerated on par with olympian gods such as the local apollo prostates hermes agoraeus or poseidonquintus smyrnaeus

pliny the elder ad in his natural history pliny mentions a port of the and an island of achilles famous for the tomb of that man situated somewhat nearby olbia and the furthermore at miles from this island he places a peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of a sword obliquely called dromos achilleos racecourse of achillespliny naturalis historia chapter and considered the place of the heros exercise or of games instituted by him this last feature of plinys account is considered to be the iconic spit landform called today tendra or kosa tendra and kosa djarilgatch situated between the mouth of the dnieper and karkinit bay but which is hardly miles c away from the estuary as pliny states to the he gives a length of whereas the spit measures today

in the following chapter of his book pliny refers to the same island as achillea and introduces two further names for it leuce or macaron from greek island of the blest the present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of achillea or leuce with todays snake islandpliny naturalis historia chapter researches which have been made at the present day place this island at a distance of miles from the borysthenes of from tyras and of fifty from the island of peuce island it is about ten miles in circumference though afterwards he speaks again of the remaining islands in the gulf of kerkinitis which are cephalonesos rhosphodusa or spodusa and macra plinys contemporary pomponius mela c ad tells that achilles was buried on an island named achillea situated between the borysthenes and the danube adding to the geographical confusionpomponius mela de situ orbis ruins of a square temple measuring meters to a side possibly that dedicated to achilles were discovered by captain kritzikly in on snake island a second exploration in showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple a fifth century bc ware lekythos inscription found on the island in reads glaukos son of poseidon dedicated me to achilles lord of leuke in another inscription from the fifth or fourth century bc a statue is dedicated to achilles lord of leuke by a citizen of olbia while in a further dedication the city of olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the islands cult again suggesting its quality as a place of a hero veneration

the heroic cult dedicated to achilles on leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic aethiopis according to which after his untimely death thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical white islandproclus chrestomathia already in the fifth century bc pindar had mentioned a cult of achilles on a bright island of the black seapindar nemea arrian periplus of the euxine sea while in another of his works pindar would retell the story of the immortalized achilles living on a geographically indefinite island of the blest together with other heroes such as his father peleus and cadmuspindar olympia well known is the connection of these mythological fortunate isles or the homeric elysium with the stream oceanus which according to greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the euxine with it guy hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by alcaeus of mytilene speaking of achilles lord of scythiad page lyrica graeca selecta oxford p no and the opposition of north and south as evoked by achilles fight against the aethiopian prince memnon mythology who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother eos after his death

the periplus ponti euxini c ad gives the following details



the greek geographer dionysius periegetes who likely lived during the first century ce wrote that the island was called leuce because the wild animals which live there are white it is said that there in leuce island reside the souls of achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this this is how jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honourdionysius periegetes orbis descriptio quoted in similarly others relate the islands name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling therearrian periplus of the euxine sea scholion to pindar nemea pausanias geographer has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame in this island there is also achilles temple and his statuepausanias description of greece leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing pausanias reports that the delphic pythia sent a lord of crotone to be cured of a chest woundpausanias description of greece ammianus marcellinus attributes the healing to waters aquae on the islandammianus marcellinus res gestae

a number of important commercial port cities of the greek waters were dedicated to achilles herodotus pliny the elder and strabo reported on the existence of a town built by settlers from mytilene in the sixth century bc close to the heros presumed burial mound in the troad later attestations point to an in messenia according to stephanus byzantinus and an in laconiapausanias description of greece nicolae recognized a connection to achilles in the names of aquileia and of the northern arm of the danube delta called chilia veche presumably from an older achileii though his conclusion that leuce had sovereign rights over the black sea evokes modern rather than archaic dacia bucharest carol

the kings of epirus ancient state claimed to be descended from achilles through his son neoptolemus alexander the great son of the epirote princess olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor he is said to have visited the tomb of achilles at achilleion of achilles while passing troyarrian anabasis alexandri cicero pro archia poeta in ad the roman emperor caracalla while on his way to war against parthia emulated alexander by holding games around achilles tumulusdio cassius




the tragedy aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about achilles given the title achilleis by modern scholars the tragedies relate the deeds of achilles during the trojan war including his defeat of hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by paris mythology and guided by apollo punctures his heel extant fragments of the achilleis and other aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play the first part of the achilleis trilogy the myrmidons focused on the relationship between achilles and chorus who represent the achaean army and try to convince achilles to give up his quarrel with only a few lines survive todaypantelis michelakis achilles in greek tragedy p in platos symposium phaedrus points out that aeschylus portrayed achilles as the lover and patroclus as the phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge himplato symposium translated benjamin jowett dover thrift editions page

the tragedian sophocles also wrote the lovers of achilles a play with achilles as the main character only a few fragments survives radt tragicorum graecorum fragmenta vol vandenhoeck ruprecht frr

towards the end of the century bce a more negative view of achilles emerges in greek euripides refers to achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in hecuba play electra euripides and iphigenia in aulislatacz



the philosopher zeno of elea centred one of zenos paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between epithets in achilles and the tortoise by which he attempted to show that achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible as a student of the monist parmenides and a member of the eleatic school zeno believed time and motion to be illusions


in hippias minor a dialogue attributed to plato an arrogant man named hippias argues with socrates the two get into a discussion about lying they decide that a person who is intentionally false must be better than a person who is unintentionally false on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying socrates uses various analogies discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point

the two also reference homer extensively socrates and hippias agree that odysseus who concocted a number of lies throughout the odyssey and other stories in the trojan war cycle was false intentionally achilles like odysseus told numerous falsehoods hippias believes that achilles was a generally honest man while socrates believes that achilles lied for his own benefit the two argue over whether its better to lie on purpose or on accident socrates eventually abandons homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally


the romans who traditionally traced their lineage to troy took a highly negative view of achilles virgil refers to achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of menaeneid while horace portrays achilles ruthlessly slaying women and childrenodes other writers such as catullus propertius and ovid represent a second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on achilles erotic career this strand continues in latin accounts of the trojan war by writers such as dictys cretensis and dares phrygius and in de roman de troie and guido delle colonnes historia destructionis troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the matter of troy until the century

achilles was described by the byzantine chronicler leo the deacon not as hellenes but as scythians while according to the byzantine author john malalas his army was made up of a tribe previously known as myrmidons and later as bulgars















































achilles has been frequently the subject of operas ballets and related genres















in films achilles has been portrayed in the following films and television series












in elisabeth of bavaria empress of austria had a summer palace built in corfu the building is named the achilleion corfu after achilles its paintings and statuary depict scenes from the trojan war with particular focus on achilles

john wilkes booth was a actor and a confederate spy from though he never joined the confederate army he had contacts with the confederate secret service after attending an april speech in which lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks booth hatched a plot to assassinate the president when booth learned of the lincolns intent to attend a play with general grant he planned to assassinate lincoln and grant at fords theatre lincoln and his wife attended the play our american cousin on the evening of april just five days after the union victory at the battle of appomattox courthouse at the last minute grant decided to go to new jersey to visit his children instead of attending the play

at booth entered the back of lincolns theater box crept up from behind and fired at the back of lincolns head mortally wounding him lincolns guest major henry rathbone momentarily grappled with booth but booth stabbed him and escaped after being attended by charles leale and two other doctors lincoln was taken across the street to petersen house after remaining in a coma for eight hours lincoln died at on april the moment of death some observers said his face seemed to relax into a smile quotes original source is hays diary which is quoted in abraham lincoln a history volume page by john g nicolay and john stanton saluted and said now he belongs to the ages lincolns body was placed in a coffin which was loaded into a hearse and escorted to the white house by union soldiers president johnson was sworn in the next morning

two weeks later booth was tracked to a farm in virginia and refusing to surrender he was mortally shot by sergeant boston corbett and died on april secretary of war stanton had issued orders that booth be taken alive so corbett was initially arrested for court martial after a brief interview stanton declared him a patriot and dismissed the charge




the late president lay in state first in the east room of the white house and then in the capitol rotunda from april through april the caskets containing lincolns body and the body of his son willie traveled for three weeks on the lincoln special funeral and burial of abraham train the train followed a circuitous route from washington dc to springfield illinois stopping at many cities for memorials attended by hundreds of thousands many others gathered along the tracks as the train passed with bands bonfires and hymn singing or in silent grief poet walt whitman composed when lilacs last in the dooryard bloomd to eulogize him one of walt whitman and abraham lincoln african americans were especially they had lost their moses in a larger sense the reaction was in response to the deaths of so many men in the war historians emphasized the widespread shock and sorrow but noted that some lincoln haters celebrated his death





as a young man lincoln was a religious skepticism he was deeply familiar with the bible quoting and praising it he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others he never made a clear profession of christian beliefs through his entire public career lincoln had a proneness for quoting scripture his three most famous house divided speech gettysburg address and abraham lincolns second inaugural contain direct allusions to providence and quotes from scripture

in the lincoln subscribed to the the doctrine of philosophical necessity illustrated a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power with the death of his son edward in he more frequently expressed a dependence on god he never joined a church although he frequently attended first presbyterian church springfield illinois with his wife beginning in claims that lincoln was baptized by an associate of alexander campbell clergyman see

in the lincoln asserted his belief in providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious country northern evangelicals and the union during the civil war and of notre the death of son willie in february may have caused him to look toward religion for solace after willies death he questioned the divine necessity of the wars severity he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest yet the contest began and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day yet the contest proceeds

lincoln did believe in an god that shaped events and by was expressing those beliefs in major speeches by the end of the war he increasingly appealed to the almighty for solace and to explain events writing on april to a newspaper editor in kentucky i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected god alone can claim it whither it is tending seems plain if god now wills the removal of a great wrong and wills also that we of the north as well as you of the south shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of godthis spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in american history and by lincoln himself as his own greatest speech or one of them at the very least lincoln explains therein the cause purpose and result of the war was gods will later in life lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs and might have been a device to reach his audiences who were mostly evangelicalism protestantism on the day lincoln was assassinated he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the holy land





lincoln is believed to have had depression mood smallpox and malaria he took blue mass pills which contained mercury element to treat constipation index paragraphs it is unknown to what extent he may have suffered from mercury poisoning

several claims have been made that lincolns health was declining before the assassination these are often based on list of photographs of abraham lincoln appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting it is also suspected that he might have had a rare genetic disease such as marfan syndrome or multiple endocrine neoplasia type





lincolns redefinition of republicanism in the united states has been stressed by historians such as john patrick diggins harry v jaffa vernon burton eric foner and herman j belz lincoln called the united states declaration of emphasized freedom and equality for sheet anchor of republicanism beginning in the he did this at a time when the constitution of the united states which tolerated slavery was the focus of most political discourse diggins notes lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself in the cooper union speech instead of focusing on the legality of an argument he focused on the moral basis of republicanism

his position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially a contract among the states and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract furthermore it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state many soldiers and religious leaders from the north though felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious age of lincoln a straus and

as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks infrastructure improvements and railroads in opposition to jacksonian democrats william c harris historian found that lincolns reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism james g randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders



in lincolns first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people

the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people view the country the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the century



in historical rankings of presidents of the united states conducted since the top three presidents are lincoln washington and franklin delano roosevelt although the order the book rating the presidents a ranking of us leaders from the great and honorable to the dishonest and incompetent acknowledges that polls have rated lincoln among the top presidents since the authors find him to be among the two best presidents along with franklin delano between and lincoln john f kennedy and ronald reagan have been the presidents in eight surveys according to gallup a study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked lincoln number one while legal scholars placed him second after george washington



lincolns assassination left him a national martyr he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty republicans linked lincolns name to their party many though not all in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability historians have said he was a classical liberal in the sense allen c guelzo states that lincoln was a classical liberal enemy of artificial hierarchy a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling and an american counterpart to mill cobden and bright whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house america

schwartz argues that lincolns american reputation grew slowly from the late century until the progressive era when he emerged as one of americas most venerated heroes even among white southerners the high point came in with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington dc

union nationalism as envisioned by lincoln helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and franklin delano roosevelt in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state


sociologist barry schwartz sociologist argues that in the and the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life during the great depression he argues lincoln served as a means for seeing the worlds disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful franklin d roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan americans asked what would lincoln however schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincolns symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept

in the cold war years lincolns image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes by the late some intellectuals led by lerone bennett jr rejected lincolns role as the great emancipator bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed sending freed slaves to another country defenders such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation

by the lincoln had become a hero to conservatism in the united and the politics of christian of missouri apart from such as mel bradford who denounced his treatment of the white south for his intense nationalism support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage his acting in terms of lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers lincoln became a favorite exemplar for liberal intellectuals across the global

historian barry schwartz wrote in that lincolns image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late century on the other hand donald opined in his biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason

in the century president barack obama named lincoln his favorite president and insisted on using the lincoln bible for his inaugural ceremonies lincoln has often been portrayed by hollywood almost always in a flattering light




lincolns portrait appears on two denominations of united states currency the penny united states coin and the united states bill his likeness also appears on many presidents of the united states on us postage specialized catalogue of united states stamps covers media while he is usually portrayed bearded he didnt grow a beard until at the suggestion of grace bedell he was the first of presidents to do pp

he has been memorialized in many town city and county names including the lincoln nebraska of nebraska the united states navy is named after lincoln the second navy ship to bear his name

lincoln memorial is one of the most visited monuments in the nations capital and is one of the top five visited national park service sites in the country fords theatre among the top sites in washington dc is across the street from petersen house where he died memorials in springfield illinois include abraham lincoln presidential library and museum lincolns home as well as lincoln tomb a portrait carving of lincoln appears with those of three other presidents on mount rushmore which receives about visitors a year















































































































































































































































































































































aristotle was a greek philosopher and polymath during the classical greece in ancient greece taught by plato he was the founder of the lyceum classical the peripatetic school of philosophy and the aristotelianism tradition his writings cover many subjects including physics aristotle biology zoology metaphysics logic ethics aesthetics poetics aristotle theatre music rhetoric psychology linguistics economics politics meteorology and government aristotle provided a complex synthesis of the various philosophies existing prior to him it was above all from his teachings that the west inherited its intellectual lexicon as well as problems and methods of inquiry as a result his philosophy has exerted a unique influence on almost every form of knowledge in the west and it continues to be a subject of contemporary philosophical discussion

little is known about his life aristotle was born in the city of stagira ancient city in northern greece his father nicomachus father of aristotle died when aristotle was a child and he was brought up by a guardian at seventeen or eighteen years of age he joined platos academy in athens and remained there until the age of circa bc shortly after plato died aristotle left athens and at the request of philip ii of macedon tutored alexander the great beginning in bc he established a library in the lyceum classical which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls though aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialogues for publication only around a third of his original output has survived none of it intended for publication

aristotles views on aristotelian physics profoundly shaped medieval scholarship their influence extended from late antiquity and the early middle ages into the renaissance and were not replaced systematically until age of enlightenment and theories such as classical mechanics were developed some of aristotles zoological observations found in aristotles biology such as on the hectocotylus of the octopus were disbelieved until the century his works contain the earliest known formal study of logic studied by medieval scholars such as peter abelard and john buridan aristotles influence on logic also continued well into the century

he influenced philosophies during the middle ages as well as christian theology especially the neoplatonism of the early church and the scholasticism tradition of the catholic church aristotle was revered among medieval muslim scholars as the first teacher and among medieval christians like thomas aquinas as simply the philosopher his ethics though always influential gained renewed interest with the modern advent of virtue ethics




in general the details of aristotles life are not the biographies written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient see covers ancient biographies of

aristotle whose name means the best purpose in ancient greek was born in in stagira ancient city chalcidice about miles east of thessaloniki his father nicomachus father of aristotle was the personal physician to amyntas iii of macedon while he was young aristotle learned about biology and medical information which was taught by his father both of aristotles parents died when he was about thirteen and proxenus of atarneus became his guardian although little information about aristotles childhood has survived he probably spent some time within the macedonian palace making his first connections with the macedonia ancient and the royal court

at the age of seventeen or eighteen aristotle moved to athens to continue his education at platonic academy he probably experienced the eleusinian mysteries as he wrote when describing the sights one viewed at the eleusinian mysteries to experience is to learn aristotle remained in athens for nearly twenty years before leaving in the traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the academys direction after control passed to platos nephew speusippus although it is possible that he feared the sentiments in athens at that time and left before plato died aristotle then accompanied xenocrates to the court of his friend hermias of atarneus in asia minor after the death of hermias aristotle travelled with his pupil theophrastus to the island of lesbos where together they researched the botany and zoology of the island and its sheltered lagoon while in lesbos aristotle married pythias either hermiass adoptive daughter or niece she bore him a daughter whom they also named pythias in bc aristotle was invited by philip ii of macedon to become the tutor to his son alexander the great



aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of macedon during aristotles time in the macedonian court he gave lessons not only to alexander but also to two other future kings ptolemy i soter and cassander aristotle encouraged alexander toward eastern conquest and aristotles own attitude towards persia was unabashedly ethnocentricism in one famous example he counsels alexander to be a leader to the greeks and a despot to the barbarians to look after the former as after friends and relatives and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants by aristotle had returned to athens establishing his own school there known as the lyceum classical aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years while in athens his wife pythias died and aristotle became involved with herpyllis of stagira who bore him a son whom he named after his father nicomachus son of aristotle if the suda an uncritical compilation from the middle ages is accurate he may also have had an eromenos palaephatus

this period in athens between and bc is when aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works he wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived those works that have survived are in treatise form and were not for the most part intended for widespread they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students his most important treatises include physics aristotle metaphysics aristotle nicomachean ethics politics aristotle on the soul and poetics aristotle aristotle studied and made significant contributions to logic metaphysics mathematics physics biology botany ethics politics agriculture medicine dance and theatre

near the end of his life alexander and aristotle became estranged over alexanders relationship with persia and persians a widespread tradition in antiquity suspected aristotle of playing a role in alexanders death but the only evidence of this is an hagnothemis made some six years after the death following alexanders death sentiment in athens was rekindled in demophilus and eurymedon the hierophant reportedly denounced aristotle for impiety prompting him to flee to his mothers family estate in chalcis at which occasion he was said to have stated i will not allow the athenians to sin twice against philosophy a reference to athenss trial of socrates he died on euboea of natural causes later that same year having named his student antipater as his chief executor and leaving a will law in which he asked to be buried next to his wife







with the prior analytics aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic and his conception of it was the dominant form of western logic until advances in mathematical logic immanuel kant stated in the critique of pure reason that with aristotle logic reached its completion










what is today called aristotelian logic with its methods of logical argument aristotle himself would have labelled analytics the term logic he reserved to mean dialectics most of aristotles work is probably not in its original form because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers the logical works of aristotle were compiled into a set of six books called the organon around bc by andronicus of rhodes or others among his followers the books are








the order of the books or the teachings from which they are composed is not certain but this list was derived from analysis of aristotles writings it goes from the basics the analysis of simple terms in the categories the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in on interpretation to the study of more complex forms namely syllogisms in the analytics and dialectics in the topics and sophistical refutations the first three treatises form the core of the logical theory stricto sensu the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning the rhetoric is not conventionally included but it states that it relies on the topics



the word metaphysics appears to have been coined by the first century ad editor who assembled various small selections of aristotles works to the treatise we know by the name metaphysics aristotle called it first philosophy and distinguished it from mathematics and natural science physics as the contemplative philosophy which is theological and studies the divine he wrote in his metaphysics






aristotle examines the concepts of substance theory ousia and essence to ti einai the what it was to be in his metaphysics book vii and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form a philosophical theory called hylomorphism in book viii he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the material substratum or the stuff of which it is composed for example the matter of a house is the bricks stones timbers etc or whatever constitutes the potential house while the form of the substance is the actual house namely covering for bodies and chattels or any other definition that let us define something as a house the formula that gives the components is the account of the matter and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form




like his teacher plato aristotles philosophy aims at the problem of universals aristotles ontology places the universal katholou in particulars kath hekaston things in the world whereas for plato the universal is a separately existing form which actual things imitate for aristotle form is still what phenomena are based on but is instantiated in a particular substance

plato argued that all things have a theory of forms which could be either a property or a relation to other things when one looks at an apple for example one sees an apple and one can also analyse a form of an apple in this distinction there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple moreover one can place an apple next to a book so that one can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things for example it is possible that there is no particular good in existence but good is still a proper universal form aristotle disagreed with plato on this point arguing that all universals are instantiated at some period of time and that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things in addition aristotle disagreed with plato about the location of universals where plato spoke of the world of forms a place where all universal forms subsist aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated so according to aristotle the form of apple exists within each apple rather than in the world of the forms




with regard to the change potentiality and actuality and its causes now as he defines in his physics aristotle and on generation and corruption he distinguishes the coming to be from







the coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property in that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality dunamis and actuality entelecheia in association with the matter and the form referring to potentiality this is what a thing is capable of doing or being acted upon if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else for example the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially dynamei a plant and if it is not prevented by something it will become a plant potentially beings can either act poiein or be acted upon paschein which can be either innate or learned for example the eyes possess the potentiality of sight innate being acted upon while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning exercise acting actuality is the fulfilment of the end of the potentiality because the end telos is the principle of every change and for the sake of the end exists potentiality therefore actuality is the end referring then to the previous example it can be said that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do



in summary the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities which is also a final cause or end then aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula in time and in substantiality with this definition of the particular substance ie matter and form aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings for example what is it that makes a man since according to plato there are two ideas animal and biped how then is man a however according to aristotle the potential being matter and the actual one form are one and the same


aristotles immanent realism means his epistemology is based on the study of things that exist or happen in the world and rises to knowledge of the universal whereas for plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal theory of forms or ideas and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these aristotle uses inductive reasoning from examples alongside deductive reasoning whereas plato relies on deduction from a priori and a posteriori principles



aristotles natural philosophy spans a wide range of natural phenomena including those now covered by physics biology and other natural sciences in aristotles terminology natural philosophy is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics biology and other natural sciences aristotles work encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry aristotle makes philosophy in the broad sense coextensive with reasoning which he also would describe as science however his use of the term science carries a different meaning than that covered by the term scientific method for aristotle all science dianoia is either practical poetical or theoretical metaphysics his practical science includes ethics and his poetical science means the study of fine arts including his theoretical science covers physics mathematics and metaphysics








in his on generation and corruption aristotle related each of the four elements proposed earlier by empedocles earth classical element water classical element air classical element and fire classical element to two of the four sensible qualities hot cold wet and dry in the empedoclean scheme all matter was made of the four elements in differing proportions aristotles scheme added the heavenly aether classical element the divine substance of the celestial spheres stars and planets



















aristotle describes two kinds of motion violent or unnatural motion such as that of a thrown stone in the physics and natural motion such as of a falling object in on the heavens in violent motion as soon as the agent stops causing it the motion stops also in other words the natural state of an object is to be at rhett allain notes that newtons first law is essentially a direct reply to aristotle that the natural state is not to change since aristotle does not address friction with this understanding it can be observed that as aristotle stated heavy objects on the ground say require more force to make them and objects pushed with greater force move leonard susskind comments that aristotle had clearly never gone ice skating or he would have seen that it takes force to stop an this would imply the equation





natural motion depends on the element concerned the aether naturally moves in a circle around the for heavenly bodies like the sun moon and stars the observed motions are to a very good approximation circular around the earths centre for example the apparent rotation of the sky because of the rotation of the earth and the rotation of the moon around the earth as aristotle while the empedoclean elements move vertically up like fire as is observed or down like earth towards their natural resting drabkin quotes numerous passages from physics and on the heavens de caelo which state aristotles laws of



in the physics aristotle effectively states a quantitative law that the speed v of a falling body is proportional say with constant c to its weight w and inversely proportional to the drabkin agrees that density is treated quantitatively in this passage but without a sharp definition of density as weight per unit of the fluid in which it is falling



aristotle implies that in a vacuum the speed of fall would become infinite and concludes from this apparent absurdity that a vacuum is not possible opinions have varied on whether aristotle intended to state quantitative laws henri carteron held the extreme view that aristotles concept of force was basically qualitative but other authors reject this

archimedes corrected aristotles theory that bodies move towards their natural resting metal boats can float if they archimedes floating depends in archimedes scheme on the mass and volume of the object not as aristotle thought its elementary composition

aristotles writings on motion remained influential until the early modern period john philoponus in the middle ages and galileo galilei are said to have shown by experiment that aristotles claim that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect a contrary opinion is given by carlo rovelli who argues that aristotles physics of motion is correct within its domain of validity that of objects in the earths gravitational field immersed in a fluid such as air in this system heavy bodies in steady fall indeed travel faster than light ones whether friction is ignored or not and they do fall more slowly in a denser philoponus and galileo correctly objected that for the transient phase still increasing in speed with heavy objects falling a short distance the law does not apply galileo used balls on a short incline to show this rovelli notes that two heavy balls with the same shape and different weight do fall at different speeds from an aeroplane confirming aristotles theory not

newtons forced motion corresponds to aristotles violent motion with its external agent but aristotles assumption that the agents effect stops immediately it stops acting eg the ball leaves the throwers hand has awkward consequences he has to suppose that surrounding fluid helps to push the ball along to make it continue to rise even though the hand is no longer acting on it resulting in the medieval theory of impetus





aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active factors his term aitia is traditionally translated as cause but it does not always refer to temporal it might be better translated as explanation but the traditional rendering will be employed here








aristotle describes experiments in optics using a camera obscura in problems aristotle book the apparatus consisted of a dark chamber with a small aperture that let light in with it he saw that whatever shape he made the hole the suns image always remained circular he also noted that increasing the distance between the aperture and the image surface magnified the image




according to aristotle spontaneity and chance are causes of some things distinguishable from other types of cause such as simple necessity chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of accident philosophy from what is spontaneous there is also more a specific kind of chance which aristotle names luck that only applies to peoples moral choices




in astronomy aristotle refuted democrituss claim that the milky way was made up of those stars which are shaded by the earth from the suns rays pointing out correctly that if the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun then the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them




aristotle was one of the first people to record any geology observations he stated that uniformitarianism was too slow to be observed in one persons lifetime
the geologist charles lyell noted that aristotle described such change including lakes that had dried up and deserts that had become watered by rivers giving as examples the growth of the nile delta since the time of homer and the upheaving of one of the aeolian islands previous to a volcanic eruption
aristotle also made many observations about the hydrologic cycle and meteorology including his major writings meteorologica for example he made some of the earliest observations about desalination he observed early and correctly that when seawater is heated freshwater evaporates and that the oceans are then replenished by the cycle of rainfall and river runoff have proved by experiment that salt water evaporated forms fresh and the vapor does not when it condenses condense into sea water







aristotle was the first person to study biology systematically and biology forms a large part of his writings he spent two years observing and describing the zoology of lesbos and the surrounding seas including in particular the pyrrha lagoon in the centre of lesbos his data in history of animals generation of animals movement of animals and parts of animals are assembled from his own ghosts by rebecca stott



aristotle reports on the visible from observation on lesbos and the catches of fishermen he describes the catfish electric ray and frogfish in detail as well as cephalopods such as the octopus and paper nautilus his description of the hectocotylus of cephalopods used in sexual reproduction was widely disbelieved until the century he gives accurate descriptions of the of ruminants and of the ovoviviparity embryological development of the hound shark

he notes that an animals structure is well matched to function so among birds the heron which lives in marshes with soft mud and lives by catching fish has a long neck and long legs and a sharp beak whereas ducks that swim have short legs and webbed feet charles darwin too noted these sorts of differences between similar kinds of animal but unlike aristotle used the data to come to the theory of evolution aristotles writings can seem to modern readers close to implying evolution but while aristotle was aware that new mutations or hybridisation biology could occur he saw these as rare accidents for aristotle accidents like heat waves in winter must be considered distinct from natural causes he was thus critical of empedocless materialist theory of a survival of the fittest origin of living things and their organs and ridiculed the idea that accidents could lead to orderly results to put his views into modern terms he nowhere says that different species can have a common descent or that one kind can speciation or that kinds can become extinction




aristotle did not do experiments in the modern sense he used the ancient greek term pepeiramenoi to mean observations or at most investigative procedures like dissection in generation of animals he finds a fertilized hens egg of a suitable stage and opens it to see the embryos heart beating inside

instead he practiced a different style of science systematically gathering data discovering patterns common to whole groups of animals and inferring possible causal explanations from these this style is common in modern biology when large amounts of data become available in a new field such as genomics it does not result in the same certainty as experimental science but it sets out testable hypotheses and constructs a narrative explanation of what is observed in this sense aristotles biology is scientific

from the data he collected and documented aristotle inferred quite a number of biological rules relating the features of the tetrapods terrestrial placental mammals that he studied among these correct predictions are the following brood size decreases with adult body mass so that an elephant has fewer young usually just one per brood than a mouse life expectancy increases with gestation period and also with body mass so that elephants live longer than mice have a longer period of gestation and are heavier as a final example fecundity decreases with lifespan so kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than kinds like mice





aristotle distinguished about species of animals arranging these in the history of animals in a graded scale of perfection a scala naturae with man at the top his system had eleven grades of animal from highest potential to lowest expressed in their form at birth the highest gave viviparity to hot and wet creatures the lowest laid cold dry eggs animals came above plants and these in turn were above minerals see also he grouped what the modern zoologist would call vertebrates as the hotter animals with blood and below them the colder invertebrates as animals without blood those with blood were divided into the mammals and the birds reptiles fish those without blood were insects crustacea cephalopods and crustacea and the molluscs bivalves and gastropods he recognised that animals did not exactly fit into a linear scale and noted various exceptions such as that sharks had a placenta like the tetrapods to a modern biologist the explanation not available to aristotle is convergent evolution he believed that purposive final causes guided all natural this teleological view justified his observed data as an expression of formal design










































aristotles psychology given in his treatise on the soul peri posits three kinds of soul psyches the vegetative soul the sensitive soul and the rational soul humans have a rational soul the human soul incorporates the powers of the other kinds like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally the unique part of the human rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and to compare them using the intellect and logos reason

for aristotle the soul is the hylomorphism of a living being because all beings are composites of form and matter the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings eg the ability to initiate movement or in the case of plants growth and chemical transformations which aristotle considers types of movement in contrast to earlier philosophers but in accordance with the egyptians he placed the rational soul in the heart rather than the brain notable is aristotles division of sensation and thought which generally differed from the concepts of previous philosophers with the exception of alcmaeon of croton



according to aristotle in on the soul memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in the mind and to distinguish between the internal appearance and an occurrence in the past in other words a memory is a mental picture wiktphantasm that can be recovered aristotle believed an impression is left on a bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory a memory occurs when stimulus psychology such as sights or sounds are so complex that the nervous system cannot receive all the impressions at once these changes are the same as those involved in the operations of sensation aristotelian and thinking

aristotle uses the term memory for the actual retaining of an experience in the impression that can develop from sensation and for the intellectual anxiety that comes with the impression because it is formed at a particular time and processing specific contents memory is of the past prediction is of the future and sensation is of the present retrieval of impressions cannot be performed suddenly a transitional channel is needed and located in past experiences both for previous experience and present experience

because aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and perceive them as impressions people are continually weaving together new impressions of experiences to search for these impressions people search the memory itself within the memory if one experience is offered instead of a specific memory that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for recollection occurs when one retrieved experience naturally follows another if the chain of images is needed one memory will stimulate the next when people recall experiences they stimulate certain previous experiences until they reach the one that is needed recollection is thus the activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory impression only humans can remember impressions of intellectual activity such as numbers and words animals that have perception of time can retrieve memories of their past observations remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed



aristotle believed the chain of thought which ends in recollection of certain impressions was connected systematically in relationships such as similarity contrast and contiguity psychology described in his laws of association aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within the mind a force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience according to aristotle association is the power innate in a mental state which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences allowing them to rise and be recalled




aristotle describes sleep in on sleep and wakefulness sleep takes place as a result of overuse of the senses or of digestion so it is vital to the body while a person is asleep the critical activities which include thinking sensing recalling and remembering do not function as they do during wakefulness since a person cannot sense during sleep they cannot have desire which is the result of sensation however the senses are able to work during sleep albeit differently unless they are weary

dreams do not involve actually sensing a stimulus in dreams sensation is still involved but in an altered manner aristotle explains that when a person stares at a moving stimulus such as the waves in a body of water and then looks away the next thing they look at appears to have a wavelike motion when a person perceives a stimulus and the stimulus is no longer the focus of their attention it leaves an impression when the body is awake and the senses are functioning properly a person constantly encounters new stimuli to sense and so the impressions of previously perceived stimuli are ignored however during sleep the impressions made throughout the day are noticed as there are no new distracting sensory experiences so dreams result from these lasting impressions since impressions are all that are left and not the exact stimuli dreams do not resemble the actual waking experience during sleep a person is in an altered state of mind aristotle compares a sleeping person to a person who is overtaken by strong feelings toward a stimulus for example a person who has a strong infatuation with someone may begin to think they see that person everywhere because they are so overtaken by their feelings since a person sleeping is in a suggestible state and unable to make judgements they become easily deceived by what appears in their dreams like the infatuated person this leads the person to believe the dream is real even when the dreams are absurd in nature in de anima iii aristotle ascribes the ability to create to store and to recall images in the absence of perception to the faculty of imagination phantasia

one component of aristotles theory of dreams disagrees with previously held beliefs he claimed that dreams are not foretelling and not sent by a divine being aristotle reasoned naturalistically that instances in which dreams do resemble future events are simply coincidences aristotle claimed that a dream is first established by the fact that the person is asleep when they experience it if a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred secondly any sensory experience that is perceived while a person is asleep does not qualify as part of a dream for example if while a person is sleeping a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut this sensory experience is not part of the dream lastly the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of waking sensory experiences



aristotles practical philosophy covers areas such as ethics politics economics and rhetoric































aristotelian just war theory is not well regarded in the present day especially his view that warfare was justified to enslave natural slaves in aristotelian philosophy the abolition of what he considers natural slavery would undermine civic freedom the pursuit of freedom is inseparable from pursuing mastery over those who deserve to be slaves according to the cambridge companion to aristotles politics the targets of this aggressive warfare were noting aristotles view that our poets say it is proper for greeks to rule

aristotle generally has a favourable opinion of war extolling it as a chance for virtue and writing that the leisure that accompanies peace tends to make people arrogant war to avoid becoming enslaved to others is justified as he writes that war compels people to be just and temperate however in order to be just war must be chosen for the sake of peace with the exception of wars of aggression discussed above





aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study ie one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake he wrote several treatises on ethics including most notably the nicomachean ethics

aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ergon of a thing an eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see because the proper function of an eye is sight aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans and that this function must be an activity of the de anima soul in accordance with reason logos aristotle identified such an optimum activity the virtuous mean between the accompanying vices of excess or of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action eudaimonia generally translated as happiness or sometimes well being to have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character arete often translated as moral or ethical virtue or excellence

aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately but by teachers and experience leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things when the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom phronesis and their intellect nous can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue the wisdom of an accomplished theoretical or speculative thinker or in other words a philosopher




in addition to his works on ethics which address the individual aristotle addressed the city in his work titled politics aristotle aristotle considered the city to be a natural community moreover he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part he famously stated that man is by nature a political animal and argued that humanitys defining factor among others in the animal kingdom is its rationality aristotle conceived of politics as being like an organism rather than like a machine and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others aristotles conception of the city is organic and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner



the common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from aristotles understanding although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires the natural community according to aristotle was the city polis which functions as a political community or partnership the aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life and to perform beautiful acts the political partnership must be regarded therefore as being for the sake of noble actions not for the sake of living together this is distinguished from modern approaches beginning with social contract theory according to which individuals leave the state of nature because of fear of violent death or its inconveniences





as disciple aristotle was rather skeptical concerning democracy and following platos vague ideas he developed a coherent theory of integrating various forms of power into a mixed state

to illustrate this approach aristotle proposed a mathematical model of voting albeit textually described where the democratic principle of one vote is combined with the oligarchic for relevant quotes and their translation into mathematical formulas see




aristotle made substantial contributions to economics especially to thought in the middle ages in politics aristotle aristotle addresses the city property and trade his response to criticisms of private property in lionel robbinss view anticipated later proponents of private property among philosophers and economists as it related to the overall utility of social arrangements aristotle believed that although communal arrangements may seem beneficial to society and that although private property is often blamed for social strife such evils in fact come from human nature in politics aristotle offers one of the earliest accounts of the origin of money money came into use because people became dependent on one another importing what they needed and exporting the surplus for the sake of convenience people then agreed to deal in something that is intrinsically useful and easily applicable such as iron or silver

aristotles discussions on retail and interest was a major influence on economic thought in the middle ages he had a low opinion of retail believing that contrary to using money to procure things one needs in managing the household retail trade seeks to make a profit economics it thus uses goods as a means to an end rather than as an end unto itself he believed that retail trade was in this way unnatural similarly aristotle considered making a profit through interest unnatural as it makes a gain out of the money itself and not from its use

aristotle gave a summary of the function of money that was perhaps remarkably precocious for his time he wrote that because it is impossible to determine the value of every good through a count of the number of other goods it is worth the necessity arises of a single universal standard of measurement money thus allows for the association of different goods and makes them commensurable he goes on to state that money is also useful for future exchange making it a sort of security that is if we do not want a thing now we shall be able to get it when we do want it





aristotles rhetoric proposes that a speaker can use three basic kinds of appeals to persuade his audience ethos an appeal to the speakers character pathos an appeal to the audiences emotion and logos an appeal to logical reasoning he also categorizes rhetoric into three genres epideictic ceremonial speeches dealing with praise or blame forensic rhetoric judicial speeches over guilt or innocence and deliberative rhetoric speeches calling on an audience to make a decision on an issue aristotle also outlines two kinds of rhetorical proof truth enthymeme proof by syllogism and paradeigma proof by example

aristotle writes in his poetics that epic poetry tragedy comedy dithyramb painting sculpture music and dance are all fundamentally acts of mimesis imitation each varying in imitation by medium object and manner he applies the term mimesis both as a property of a work of art and also as the product of the artists intention and contends that the audiences realisation of the mimesis is vital to understanding the work itself aristotle states that mimesis is a natural instinct of humanity that separates humans from animals and that all human artistry follows the pattern of nature because of this aristotle believed that each of the mimetic arts possesses what stephen halliwell academic calls highly structured procedures for the achievement of their purposes for example music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone and poetry with language the forms also differ in their object of imitation comedy for instance is a dramatic imitation of men worse than whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average lastly the forms differ in their manner of imitation through narrative or character through change or no change and through drama or no drama

while it is believed that aristotles poetics originally comprised two books one on comedy and one on tragedy only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements character style thought spectacle and lyric poetry the characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the and the plot not the characters is the chief focus of tragedy tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear and is meant to effect the catharsis of those same emotions aristotle concludes poetics with a discussion on which if either is superior epic or tragic mimesis he suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music is more unified and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope it can be considered superior to epic aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles folklore and he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the pythia and studied the fables of aesop





aristotles analysis of procreation describes an active ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert passive female element on this ground proponents of feminist metaphysics have accused aristotle of misogyny and sexism however aristotle gave equal weight to womens happiness as he did to mens and commented in his rhetoric that the things that lead to happiness need to be in women as well as where as among the lacedaemonians the state of women is bad almost half of human life is




more than years after his death aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived he contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence and he was the founder of many new fields according to the philosopher bryan magee it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did among countless other achievements aristotle was the founder of formal logic pioneered the study of zoology and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method taneli kukkonen writing in the classical tradition observes that his achievement in founding two sciences is unmatched and his reach in influencing every branch of intellectual enterprise including western ethical and political theory theology rhetoric and literary analysis is equally long as a result kukkonen argues any analysis of reality today will almost certainly carry aristotelian overtones evidence of an exceptionally forceful mind jonathan barnes wrote that an account of aristotles intellectual afterlife would be little less than a history of european thought





aristotles pupil and successor theophrastus wrote the historia plantarum theophrastus a pioneering work in botany some of his technical terms remain in use such as carpel from carpos fruit and pericarp from pericarpion seed chamber
theophrastus was much less concerned with formal causes than aristotle was instead pragmatically describing how plants functioned




the immediate influence of aristotles work was felt as the lyceum grew into the peripatetic school aristotles notable students included aristoxenus dicaearchus demetrius of phalerum eudemos of rhodes harpalus hephaestion mnason of phocis nicomachus son of aristotle and theophrastus aristotles influence over alexander the great is seen in the latters bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists botanists and researchers he had also learned a great deal about persian people customs and traditions from his teacher although his respect for aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of aristotles geography was clearly wrong when the old philosopher released his works to the public alexander complained thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic for in what shall i surpass other men if those doctrines wherein i have been trained are to be all mens common




after theophrastus the lyceum failed to produce any original work though interest in aristotles ideas survived they were generally taken unquestioningly it is not until the age of alexandria under the ptolemaic kingdom that advances in biology can be again found

the first medical teacher at alexandria herophilos corrected aristotle placing intelligence in the brain and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation herophilus also distinguished between veins and artery noting that the latter pulse while the former do not though a few ancient atomism such as lucretius challenged the teleology viewpoint of aristotelian ideas about life teleology and after the rise of christianity natural theology would remain central to biological thought essentially until the and centuries ernst mayr states that there was nothing of any real consequence in biology after lucretius and galen until the renaissance




greek christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of aristotle by copying all the extant greek language manuscripts of the corpus the first greek christians to comment extensively on aristotle were philoponus elias and david in the sixth century and stephen of alexandria in the early seventh century john philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of aristotles views on the eternity of the world movement and other elements of aristotelian thought philoponus questioned aristotles teaching of physics noting its flaws and introducing the theory of impetus to explain his observations

after a hiatus of several centuries formal commentary by eustratius and michael of ephesus reappeared in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries apparently sponsored by anna comnena





aristotle was one of the most revered western thinkers in early islamic theology most of the still extant works of aristotle as well as a number of the original greek commentaries were translated into arabic and studied by muslim philosophers scientists and scholars averroes avicenna and alpharabius who wrote on aristotle in great depth also influenced thomas aquinas and other western christian scholastic philosophers alkindus greatly admired aristotles philosophy and averroes spoke of aristotle as the exemplar for all future philosophers medieval muslim scholars regularly described aristotle as the first teacher the title teacher was first given to aristotle by muslim scholars and was later used by western philosophers as in the famous poem of dante alighieri who were influenced by the tradition of islamic philosophy






with the loss of the study of ancient greek in the early medieval latin west aristotle was practically unknown there from c ad to c except through the latin translation of the organon made by boethius in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries interest in aristotle revived and latin christians had translations made both from arabic translations such as those by gerard of cremona and from the original greek such as those by james of venice and william of moerbeke after the scholasticism thomas aquinas wrote his summa theologica working from moerbekes translations and calling aristotle the philosopher the demand for aristotles writings grew and the greek language manuscripts returned to the west stimulating a revival of aristotelianism in europe that continued into the renaissance these thinkers blended aristotelian philosophy with christianity bringing the thought of ancient greece into the middle ages scholars such as boethius peter abelard and john buridan worked on aristotelian logic

the medieval english poet geoffrey chaucer describes his student as being happy by having





a the tale of phyllis and aristotle held that aristotle advised his pupil alexander to avoid the kings seductive mistress phyllis but was himself captivated by her and allowed her to ride him phyllis had secretly told alexander what to expect and he witnessed phyllis proving that a womans charms could overcome even the greatest philosophers male intellect artists such as hans baldung produced a series of illustrations of the popular theme

the italian poet dante says of aristotle in the divine comedy








che nnanzi a li altri presso li saw the master there of those who know










in the early modern period scientists such as william harvey in england and galileo galilei in italy reacted against the theories of aristotle and other classical era thinkers like galen establishing new theories based to some degree on observation and experiment harvey demonstrated the circulation of the blood establishing that the heart functioned as a pump rather than being the seat of the soul and the controller of the bodys heat as aristotle thought galileo used more doubtful arguments to displace aristotles physics proposing that bodies all fall at the same speed whatever their weight



the german philosopher friedrich nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from aristotle aristotle rigidly separated action from production and argued for the deserved subservience of some people natural slaves and the natural superiority virtue arete of others it was martin heidegger not nietzsche who elaborated a new interpretation of aristotle intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition

the english mathematician george boole fully accepted aristotles logic but decided to go under over and beyond it with his system of boolean algebra in his book the laws of thought this gives logic a mathematical foundation with equations enables it to solve equations as well as check validity logic and allows it to handle a wider class of problems by expanding propositions of any number of terms not just two




during the century aristotles work was widely criticized the philosopher bertrand russell
argued that almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some aristotelian doctrine russell called aristotles ethics repulsive and labelled his logic as definitely antiquated as ptolemaic astronomy russell stated that these errors made it difficult to do historical justice to aristotle until one remembered what an advance he made upon all of his predecessors

the dutch historian of science eduard jan dijksterhuis wrote that aristotle and his predecessors showed the difficulty of science by proceeding so readily to frame a theory of such a general character on limited evidence from their senses in the biologist peter medawar could still state in pure seventeenth century tones that aristotle had assembled a strange and generally speaking rather tiresome farrago of hearsay imperfect observation wishful thinking and credulity amounting to downright gullibility

by the start of the century however aristotle was taken more seriously kukkonen noted that in the best scholarship aristotle comes alive as a thinker wrestling with the full weight of the greek philosophical tradition alasdair macintyre has attempted to reform what he calls the aristotelian tradition in a way that is and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and nietzscheans kukkonen observed too that that most enduring of romantic images aristotle tutoring the future conqueror alexander remained current as in the film alexander film while the firm rules of aristotles theory of drama have ensured a role for the poetics in cinema of the united states

biologists continue to be interested in aristotles thinking armand marie leroi has reconstructed aristotles biology while tinbergens four questions based on aristotles four causes are used to analyse animal they examine function biology phylogeny mechanism biology and ontogeny







the works of aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the corpus aristotelicum these texts as opposed to aristotles lost works are technical philosophical treatises from within aristotles school reference to them is made according to the organization of immanuel bekkers royal prussian academy edition aristotelis opera edidit academia regia borussica berlin which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works




aristotle wrote his works on papyrus scrolls the common writing medium of that when the roman dictator sulla invaded athens in bc he brought back to rome a fantastic prize aristotles library books then were papyrus rolls from to feet long and since aristotles death in bc worms and damp had done their worst the rolls needed repairing and the texts clarifying and copying on to new papyrus imported from egypt moses bulrushes the man in rome who put aristotles library in order was a greek scholar his writings are divisible into two groups the exoteric intended for the public and the esoteric for use within the lyceum classical school aristotles lost works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving aristotelian corpus whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with a view to subsequent publication the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes not intended for publication ciceros description of aristotles literary style as a river of gold must have applied to the published works not the surviving veniet flumen orationis aureum fundens aristoteles google translation aristotle will come pouring forth a golden stream of a major question in the history of aristotles works is how the exoteric writings were all lost and how the ones now possessed came to be found the consensus is that andronicus of rhodes collected the esoteric works of aristotles school which existed in the form of smaller separate works distinguished them from those of theophrastus and other peripatetics edited them and finally compiled them into the more cohesive larger works as they are known today






aristotle has been depicted by major artists including lucas cranach the elder justus van gent raphael paolo veronese jusepe de ribera rembrandt and francesco hayez over the centuries among the depictions is raphaels fresco the school of athens in the apostolic palace where the figures of plato and aristotle are central to the image at the architectural vanishing point reflecting their importance rembrandts aristotle with a bust of homer too is a celebrated work showing the knowing philosopher and the blind homer from an earlier age as the art critic jonathan jones journalist writes this painting will remain one of the greatest and most mysterious in the world ensnaring us in its musty glowing terrible knowledge of time


























the aristotle mountains in antarctica are named after aristotle he was the first person known to conjecture in his book meteorology aristotle the existence of a landmass in the southern region and called it antarctica aristoteles crater is a crater on the moon bearing the classical form of aristotles name

although the story is likely apocryphal gershwin is said to have been attracted by maurice ravels unusual chords and gershwin went on his first trip to paris in ready to study with ravel after his initial student audition with ravel turned into a sharing of musical theories ravel said he could not teach him saying why be a ravel when you can be a

gershwin strongly encouraged ravel to come to the united states for a tour to this end upon his return to new york gershwin joined the efforts of ravels friend e robert schmitz a pianist ravel had met during the war to urge ravel to tour the us schmitz was the head of pro musica promoting musical relations and was able to offer ravel a fee for the tour an enticement gershwin knew would be important to ravel

gershwin greeted ravel in new york in march during a party held for ravels birthday by gauthier ravels tour reignited gershwins desire to return to paris which he and his brother ira gershwin did after meeting ravel ravels high praise of gershwin in an introductory letter to nadia boulanger caused gershwin to seriously consider taking much more time to study abroad in paris yet after he played for her she told him she could not teach him boulanger gave gershwin basically the same advice she gave all her accomplished master students what could i give you that you havent already this did not set gershwin back as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his rhapsody in blue paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers among them ezra pound w b yeats ernest and artist pablo picassolsri archives oral interview anita loos and mary anita loos october re letters and ravels telegram to gershwin





























gershwin based an american in paris on a melodic fragment called very parisienne written in on his first visit to paris as a gift to his hosts robert and mabel schirmer gershwin called it a rhapsodic it is written freely and in a much more modern idiom than his prior works

gershwin explained in musical america my purpose here is to portray the impressions of an american visitor in paris as he strolls about the city listens to the various street noises and absorbs the french atmosphere

the piece is structured into five sections which culminate in a loose ternary form gershwins first a episode introduces the two main walking themes in the allegretto grazioso and develops a third theme in the subito con brio the style of this a section is written in the typical french style of composers claude debussy and les six this a section featured duple meter singsong rhythms and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe english horn and taxi horns the b sections andante ma con ritmo deciso introduces the american blues and spasms of homesickness the allegro that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster blues in the b section gershwin uses common time syncopated rhythms and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet saxophone and snare drum moderato con grazia is the last a section that returns to the themes set in a after recapitulating the walking themes gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section b in the final grandioso












gershwin did not particularly like walter damroschs interpretation at the world premiere of an american in paris he stated that damroschs sluggish dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work the audience according to edward cushing responded with a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music good and bad ordinarily arouses critics believed that an american in paris was better crafted than his concerto in f gershwin some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers franck richard wagner or guillaume lekeu on its premiere gershwin responded to the critics




an american in paris was originally scored for flutes doubling on piccolo oboes english horn clarinets in soprano clarinet bass clarinet in bassoons contrabassoon french horn in f trumpets in trombones tuba timpani snare drum bass drum triangle musical instrument woodblock instrument ratchet instrument cymbals low and high drum xylophone glockenspiel celesta vehicle horn labeled as a b c and d with circles around them alto saxophone tenor saxophone baritone saxophone all saxophones doubling soprano saxophones and string section although most modern audiences have heard the taxi horns using the notes a b c and d it has recently come to light that gershwins intention was to have used the notes ascientific pitch notation and it is likely that in labeling the taxi horns as a b c and d with circles he was referring to the four horns and not the notes that they played

a major revision of the work by composer and arranger f simplified the instrumentation by reducing the saxophones to only three instruments alto tenor and baritone the soprano saxophone doublings were eliminated to avoid changing instruments and the contrabassoon was also deleted this became the standard performing edition until when gershwin specialist jack gibbons made his own restoration of the original orchestration of an american in paris working directly from gershwins original manuscript including the restoration of gershwins soprano saxophone parts removed in gibbons restored orchestration of an american in paris was performed at londons queen elizabeth hall on july by the city of oxford orchestra conducted by levon parikian

william merrigan daly arranged the score for piano this was published by new world music in


on september it was announced that a musicological historical editions music of the full orchestral score would be eventually released the gershwin family working in conjunction with the library of congress and the university of michigan were working to make scores available to the public that represent gershwins true intent it was unknown whether the critical score would include the four minutes of material gershwin later deleted from the work such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster bar blues section or if the score would document changes in the orchestration during gershwins composition process

the score to an american in paris was scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released the entire project was expected take to years to complete but an american in paris was planned to be an early volume in the series

two urtext editions of the work were published by the german publisher music in the changes made by were withdrawn in both editions in the extended urtext bars of music were conductor walter damrosch had cut them shortly before the first performance

on september the cincinnati symphony orchestra gave the world premiere of the critical edition of the piece prepared by mark clague director of the gershwin initiative at the university of michigan this performance was of the original orchestration except that it upheld the deletion of the contrabassoon part an alteration usually attributed to f


an american in paris has been frequently recorded the first recording was made for the victor talking machine company in with nathaniel shilkret conducting the victor symphony orchestra drawn from members of the philadelphia orchestra gershwin was on hand to supervise the however shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio then a little later shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief celesta solo during the slow section so he hastily asked gershwin if he might play the gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording this recording is believed to use the taxi horns in the way that gershwin had intended using the notes a higher d and a lower a the radio broadcast of the september hollywood bowl george gershwin memorial concert in which an american in paris also conducted by shilkret was second on the program was recorded and was released in in a set arthur fiedler and the boston pops orchestra recorded the work for rca victor including one of the first stereo recordings of the music in arturo toscanini conducting the nbc symphony orchestra recorded the piece for rca victor one of the few commercial recordings toscanini made of music by an american composer the seattle symphony also recorded a version in of gershwins original score before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today harry james released a version of the blues section on his album one night stand recorded live at the aragon ballroom chicago columbia records gl and cl

the award was originally sculpted by george stanley sculptor from a design sketch by cedric gibbons ampas first academy awards at a private dinner hosted by douglas fairbanks in the hollywood roosevelt hotel in what would become known as the academy awards the academy awards ceremony was first broadcast by radio in and was televised for the first time in it is the oldest worldwide entertainment awards ceremony and is now televised live worldwide it is also the oldest of the its equivalents the emmy awards for television the tony awards for theater and the grammy awards for music are modeled after the academy awards they are widely cited as the most famous and prestigious competitive awards in the field of entertainment

the academy awards ceremony honoring the in film was held on february as with academy awards there was no host the ceremony was broadcast on american broadcasting company it took place at the dolby theatre in los angeles california for the consecutive year this ceremony marked the first time in oscar history that more than three films had received ten or more nominations a total of oscar statuettes have been awarded since its inception in

the first best actor awarded was emil jannings for his performances in the last command film and the way of all flesh film he had to return to europe before the ceremony so the academy agreed to give him the prize this made him the first academy award winner in history at that time winners were recognized for the entirety of their work done in a certain category during the qualifying for example jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and janet gaynor later won a single oscar for performances in three films with the fourth ceremony however the system changed and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film for the first six ceremonies the eligibility period spanned two calendar years

at the ceremony held in the best foreign language film category now known as academy award for best international feature film was introduced until then films had been honored with the special achievement award

perhaps the most widely seen streaking in history was robert opel who streaked across the stage of the dorothy chandler pavilion in los angeles flashing a peace sign on national us television at the academy awards in bemused host david niven quipped isnt it fascinating to think that probably the only laugh that man will ever get in his life is by stripping off and showing his later evidence arose suggesting that opels appearance was facilitated as a publicity stunt by the shows producer jack haley jr robert metzler the shows business manager believed that the incident had been planned in some during the dress rehearsal niven had asked metzlers wife to borrow a pen so he could write down the famous line which was thus not the it appeared to be

the best known award is the academy award of merit more popularly known as the oscar statuette made of bronze on a black metal base it is tall weighs and depicts a knight rendered in art deco style holding a crusades sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes the five spokes represent the original branches of the academy actors writers directors producers and technicians

sculptor george stanley sculptor who also did the muse fountain at the hollywood bowl sculpted cedric gibbons design the statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were solid bronze within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of britannia metal a alloy which is then plated in copper nickel silver and finally gold due to a metal shortage during world war ii oscars were made of painted plaster for three years following the war the academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for metal ones the only addition to the oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base the original oscar mold was cast in at the cw shumway sons foundry in batavia illinois illinois which also contributed to casting the molds for the vince lombardi trophy and emmy awards statuettes from to approximately oscars in a tin alloy with gold plating were made each year in chicago by illinois manufacturer rs owens company lodi it would take between three and four weeks to manufacture statuettes in the academy returned to bronze as the core metal of the statuettes handing manufacturing duties to walden new york new polich tallix fine art foundry while based on a digital scan of an original oscar the statuettes retain their dimensions and black pedestal cast in liquid bronze from ceramic molds and polished they are then electroplated in gold by brooklyn new york new epner technology the time required to produce such statuettes is roughly three months rs owens is expected to continue producing other awards for the academy and service existing oscars that need replating


the academy officially adopted the name oscar for the trophies in however the origin of the nickname is disputed

one biography of bette davis who was a president of the academy in claims she named the award after her first husband band leader harmon oscar nelson a frequently mentioned originator is margaret herrick the academy executive secretary who when she first saw the award in said the statuette reminded her of uncle oscar a nickname for her cousin oscar pierce


columnist sidney skolsky who was present during herricks naming in wrote that employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette oscar the academy credits skolsky with the first confirmed newspaper reference to oscar in his column on march which was written about that years academy awards the awards appeared again in another early media mention of oscar a time magazine storysubscription required in the ceremonies that year walt disney was the first to thank the academy for his oscar during his acceptance speech


to prevent information identifying the oscar winners from leaking ahead of the ceremony oscar statuettes presented at the ceremony have blank baseplates until winners returned their statuettes to the academy and had to wait several weeks to have their names inscribed on their respective oscars since winners have had the option of having engraved nameplates applied to their statuettes at an station at the governors ball a party held immediately after the oscar ceremony the rs owens company has engraved nameplates made before the ceremony bearing the name of every potential winner the nameplates for the nominees are later recycled


prior to oscar statuettes were and remain the property of the recipient since then the statuettes have been legally encumbrance by the requirement that the statuette be first offered for sale back to the academy for if a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation then the academy keeps the statuette academy awards predating this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for sums

in mike todd grandson tried to sell todds academy award for best picture oscar for his production of around the world in days film to a movie prop collector the academy earned enforcement of its statuette contract by gaining a permanent injunction against the sale

in harold russell consigned his oscar for best supporting actor for the best years of our lives to auction in order to raise money for his wifes medical expenses though his decision caused controversy the oscar to be sold passed to a private collector on august for today russell defended his action saying i dont know why anybody would be critical my wifes health is much more important than sentimental reasons the movie will be here even if oscar isnt

in december orson welles oscar for citizen kane academy award for best original screenplay was put up for auction after his heirs won a court decision contending that welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the academy on december it sold in an online auction for today

according to rules and of the official academy awards rules a film must open in the previous calendar year from midnight at the start of january to midnight at the end of december in los angeles county california california and play for seven consecutive days to qualify except for the best international feature film best documentary feature and awards in short film categories additionally the film must be shown at least three times on each day of its qualifying run with at least one of the daily showings starting between and local time

for example the academy award for best picture winner the hurt locker was actually first released in but did not qualify for the academy awards as it did not play its run in los angeles until thus qualifying for the academy awards foreign films must include english subtitles and each country can submit only one film for consideration in the international feature film category per year

film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on for your consideration advertising for a movie in the running for best picture in attempts to improve chances of receiving oscars and other movie awards conferred in oscar season the academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified it has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders for example a producer of the best picture nominee the hurt locker was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as the the hurt locker eventually won







the major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony commonly in late february or early march following the relevant calendar year and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees it is the culmination of the film awards season which usually begins during november or december of the previous year this is an elaborate extravaganza with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day black tie dress is the most common outfit for men although fashion may dictate not wearing a and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this the artists who recorded the nominees for best original song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast

the academy awards is the worlds awards show televised live from the us to all time zones in north america and worldwide and gathers billions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world the oscars were first televised in academy awards by nbc which continued to broadcast the event until academy awards when american broadcasting company took over televising the festivities including the first color broadcast of the event in academy awards through academy awards nbc regained the rights for five years then abc resumed broadcast duties in academy awards and its current contract with the academy runs through the academy has also produced condensed versions of the ceremony for broadcast in international markets especially those outside of the americas in more desirable local timeslots the ceremony was broadcast live internationally for the first time via satellite since but only two south american countries chile and brazil purchased the rights to air the broadcast by that time the television rights to the academy awards had been sold in countries a decade later the rights were already being sold to countries and by academy awards the tv rights to the awards were licensed in countries

the ceremonies were moved up from late april to late february since academy awards to help disrupt and shorten the intense for your consideration advertising associated with oscar season in the film industry another reason was because of the growing tv ratings success coinciding with the ncaa division i mens basketball tournament which would cut into the academy awards audience in academy awards and academy awards abcs regained oscars were moved from tuesday to monday and went directly opposite nbcs ncaa title game the earlier date is also to the advantage of abc as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important february sweeps period some years the ceremony is moved into the first sunday of march to avoid a clash with the winter olympic games another reason for the move to late february and early march is also to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of passover and easter which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public advertising is somewhat restricted however as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official academy award sponsors may advertise during the telecast the production of the academy awards telecast currently holds the distinction of winning the most emmy awards in history with wins and nominations overall since that awards own launch in academy awards

after many years of being held on mondays at eastern time pm pacific time zone since the academy awards it was moved to sundays at pt the reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on sundays that los angeles traffic jams could be avoided and an earlier start time would allow viewers on the east coast to go to bed earlier academy awards will move to sunday night reading eagle july from google news archive for many years the film industry opposed a sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office never say never academy awards move to sunday the item march google news archive in the academy contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into january citing tv viewers fatigue with the film industrys long awards season however such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail furthermore a january ceremony on sunday would clash with national football league playoff games in the academy announced that the ceremony would be moved from late february to mid february beginning with the academy awards in

originally scheduled for april the academy awards ceremony was postponed for two days because of the assassination of martin luther king jr of martin luther king jr on march the academy awards was postponed for one day after attempted assassination of ronald reagan of president ronald reagan and others in washington dc

in an in memoriam segment was introduced honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding months a selection compiled by a small committee of academy members this segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names criticism was also levied for many years regarding another aspect with the segment having a popularity contest feel as the audience varied their applause to those who had died by the subjects cultural the applause has since been muted during the telecast and the audience is discouraged from clapping during the segment and giving silent reflection instead this segment was later followed by a commercial break

in terms of broadcast length the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours the first oscars in lasted at the other end of the spectrum the ceremony lasted four hours and minutesehbar ned february did you metro new york city p in the organizers of the academy awards announced winners oscar speech must not run past this according to organizer bill mechanic was to ensure the elimination of what he termed the single most hated thing on the show overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion in in a further effort to streamline speeches winners dedications were displayed on an news ticker during the ceremony host jimmy kimmel acknowledged how long the ceremony had become by announcing that he would give a jet ski to whoever gave the shortest speech of the night a reward won by mark bridges designer when accepting his academy award for best costume design award for phantom the wall street journal analyzed the average minutes spent across the telecasts as follows on song on the hosts on prerecorded and on the awards themselves broken into on the introduction and announcement on winners walking to the stage and on their acceptance speeches

although still dominant in ratings the viewership of the academy awards has steadily the academy awards were the in the past eight years although with increases in male and viewership while the show itself also faced mixed reception following the show variety magazine reported that abc was in negotiating an extension to its contract to broadcast the oscars seeking to have more creative control over the broadcast itself currently and nominally ampas is responsible for most aspects of the telecast including the choice of production staff and hosting although abc is allowed to have some input on their decisions in august ampas extended its contract with abc through the contract neither contains any notable changes nor gives abc any further creative control over the telecast


historically the telecasts viewership is higher when hits are favored to win the best picture award more than viewers tuned to the telecast for the academy awards in the year of titanic film which generated a box office haul during its initial run of in the us a box office record that would remain unsurpassed for years the academy awards ceremony in which the lord of the rings the return of the king box office earnings of received awards including best picture drew viewers the most watched ceremony based on nielsen ratings to date however was the academy awards best picture midnight cowboy which drew a household rating on april

by contrast ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings despite how much critically acclaimed those films have been the academy awards which awarded independent film crash film with a gross of generated an audience of with a household rating of in the academy awards telecast was watched by viewers on average with an household rating the and ceremony at the time in spite of celebrating years of the academy awards the best picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independent film no country for old men




the academy film archive holds copies of every academy awards ceremony since the oscars and material on many prior ceremonies along with ancillary material related to more recent shows copies are held on a variety of film video and digital formats


in the first academy awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the hollywood roosevelt hotel from to the ceremony alternated between two venues the ambassador hotel los angeles on wilshire boulevard and the millennium biltmore hotel in downtown los angeles

graumans chinese theatre in hollywood then hosted the awards from to followed by the shrine auditorium in los angeles from to the academy awards in were held at the academy award theatre at what had been the academys headquarters on melrose avenue in hollywood

from to the awards were presented at hollywoods pantages theatre hollywood with the advent of television the awards from to took place simultaneously in hollywood and new york first at the majestic theatre columbus circle and then at the new century theatre after which the ceremony took place solely in los angeles the oscars moved to the santa monica civic auditorium in santa monica california california in by the academy decided to move the ceremonies back to downtown los angeles this time to the dorothy chandler pavilion at the los angeles music center in the late and early the ceremony returned to the shrine

in hollywoods dolby theatre previously known as the kodak theatre became the presentations current venue






























in the first year of the awards the best directing award was split into two categories drama and comedy at times the best original score award has also been split into separate categories drama and from the through the the art direction now production design cinematography and costume design awards were likewise split into two categories films and color films prior to the production design award was called art direction while the makeup and hairstyling award was called makeup

in august the academy announced that several categories would not be televised live but rather be recorded during commercial breaks and aired later in the ceremony
following dissent from academy members they announced that they would indeed air all categories live this followed a number of proposals among them the introduction of a popular film category that the academy had announced but did not implement




















the board of governors meets each year and considers new award categories to date the following categories have been proposed






the special academy awards are voted on by special committees rather than by the academy membership as a whole they are not always presented on an annual basis

















due to the positive exposure and prestige of the academy awards many studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the oscar season this has generated accusations of the academy awards being influenced more by marketing than by quality william friedkin an academy film director and former producer of the ceremony expressed this sentiment at a conference in new york in describing it as the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself

tim dirks editor of american movie classics filmsiteorg has written of the academy awards





typical criticism of the academy awards for best picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an of romantic historical epics biographical dramas romantic dramedies and family melodramas most of which are released in the us the last three months of the calendar year the oscars have been infamously known for selecting specific genres of movies to be awarded the term oscar bait was coined to describe such movies this has led at times to more specific criticisms that the academy is disconnected from the audience eg by favoring oscar bait over audience favorites or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues


the academy awards have long received criticism over its lack of diversity among the nominees this criticism is based on the statistics from every academy awards since which shows us that only of academy award nominees have been and since of nominees have been with the rate of winners being even more polarizing more white actresses have won oscars for examples of yellowface portrayals of asian characters than actual asian actresses the academy awards became the target of a boycott popularized on social media with the hashtag based on critics perception that its acting nominee list reflected bias in response the academy initiated historic changes in membership by the year


acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for personal popularity to make up for a snub for a work that proved in time to be more popular or renowned than the one actually awarded or presented as a career honor to recognize a distinguished nominees entire body of work


following the academy awards in february in which the film roma film had been nominated for ten awards including the best picture category steven spielberg and other members of the academy discussed changing the requirements through the board of governors for films as to exclude those from netflix and other media streaming services spielberg had been concerned that netflix as a movie production and distribution studio could spend much more than typical films and have much wider and earlier distribution than other best films while still being able to meet the minimal status to qualify for an oscar the united states department of justice having heard of this potential rule change wrote a letter to the academy in march cautioning them that placing additional restrictions on films that originate from streaming media services without proper justification could raise concerns against the academy following its april board meeting the academy board of governors agreed to retain the current rules that allow for streaming media films to be eligible for oscars as long as they enjoy limited theatrical runs


some winners critical of the academy awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their oscars the first to do so was screenwriter dudley nichols best writing in for the informer nichols boycotted the academy awards ceremony because of conflicts between the academy and the writers guild nichols eventually accepted the award three years later at the ceremony nichols was nominated for three further academy awards during his career

george c scott became the second person to refuse his award best actor in for patton at the academy awards ceremony scott described it as a meat parade saying i dont want any part of it

the third person to refuse the award was marlon brando who refused his award best actor for the godfather citing the film industrys discrimination and mistreatment of indigenous peoples of the americas at the academy awards ceremony brando sent actress and civil rights activist sacheen littlefeather to read a speech detailing his criticisms for which there was booing and cheering by the audience


at the academy awards ceremony warren beatty and faye dunaway mistakenly announced la la land film as the recipient of the best picture award instead of moonlight film the actual winner beatty had been given the wrong envelope and after hesitating during the announcement handed the envelope to dunaway which listed emma stone as best actress for la la land and led to the confusion the proper winner was announced after the acceptance speeches by la la land producers fred berger producer jordan horowitz and marc platt producer

the academy awards beatty and dunaway were invited back as presenters of the best picture award which they accomplished without error







nine films have been disqualified before an official award ceremony because they violated the regulations








one film was disqualified after winning the award and had the winner return the oscar




the following events are closely associated with the annual academy awards











it has become a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the oscars in recent years these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners the value of each of these gift bags can reach into the tens of thousands of dollars in the value was reported to be as high as the value has risen to the point where the us internal revenue service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status
oscar gift bags have included vacation packages to hawaii and mexico and japan a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at a restaurant videotelephonys a stay at a hotel watches bracelets spa treatments bottles of vodka maple salad dressing gummie candy and up to worth of cosmetic treatments and rejuvenation procedures such as lip fillers and chemical peels from new york city facial plastic surgeon konstantin vasyukevich some of the gifts have even had a risque element to in the adult products retailer adam eve company had a secret room gifting suite celebrities visiting the gifting suite included judith hoag carolyn hennesy kate linder chris mulkey jim oheir and john salley

international atomic time tai from the french name temps atomique is a atomic clock coordinate time time standard based on the notional passage of proper time on earths geoid it is the principal realisation of terrestrial time with a fixed offset of epoch it is also the basis for coordinated universal time utc which is used for civil timekeeping all over the earths surface when another leap second was added tai is exactly seconds ahead of utc the seconds results from the initial difference of seconds at the start of plus leap seconds in utc since

tai may be reported using traditional means of specifying days carried over from time standards based on the rotation of the earth specifically both julian days and the gregorian calendar are used tai in this form was synchronised with universal time at the beginning of and the two have drifted apart ever since due to the changing motion of the earth


tai is a weighted average of the time kept by over atomic clocks in over national laboratories web





the participating institutions each broadcast in data a frequency signal with timecodes which is their estimate of tai time codes are usually published in the form of utc which differs from tai by a integer number of seconds these time scales are denoted in the form utcnpl in the utc form where npl in this case identifies the national physical laboratory uk the tai form may be denoted tainpl the latter is not to be confused with tanpl which denotes an independent atomic time scale not synchronised to tai or to anything else

the clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other the international bureau of weights and measures bipm france combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible this combined time scale is published monthly in circular t and is the canonical form tai this time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences utc utck equivalent to tai for each participating institution k the same circular also gives tables of tai tak for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales

errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty circular t or by errata in a subsequent circular t aside from this once published in circular t the tai scale is not revised in hindsight it is possible to discover errors in tai and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale since the published circulars are definitive better estimates do not create another version of it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of terrestrial time tt


early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic the atomic clocks were not operated continuously atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in using the first caesium atomic clock at the national physical laboratory united kingdom it was used as a basis for calibrating the quartz clocks at the royal greenwich observatory and to establish a time scale called greenwich atomic ga the united states naval observatory began the scale on september using an atomichron commercial atomic clock followed by the scale at the national bureau of standards boulder colorado on october

the international time bureau bih began a time scale tm or am in july using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of vlf radio signals the bih scale and were defined by an epoch date reference at the beginning of were set to read julian date january at the corresponding instant however each observatory used its own value of the procedures used by the bih evolved and the name for the time scale changed in and tabih in

the si second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in from to the general conference on weights and measures and the international committee for weights and measures made a series of decisions which designated the bipm time scale international atomic time tai

in the it became clear that the clocks participating in tai were ticking at different rates due to gravitational time dilation and the combined tai scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks starting from julian date january corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks so that tai would correspond to proper time at the geoid mean sea level because the clocks were on average well above sea level this meant that tai slowed by about one part in a trillion the former uncorrected time scale continues to be published under the name eal echelle atomique libre meaning free atomic scale

the instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for barycentric coordinate time tcb geocentric coordinate time tcg and terrestrial time tt which represent three fundamental time scales in the solar system all three of these time scales were defined to read jd january exactly at that instant tai was henceforth a realisation of tt with the equation tttai tai

the continued existence of tai was questioned in a letter from the bipm to the which stated in the case of a redefinition of utc without leap seconds the cctf would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing tai as it would remain parallel to the continuous web








utc is a discontinuous time scale it is occasionally adjusted by leap seconds between these adjustments it is composed of segments that are mapped to atomic time from its beginning in through december the adjustments were made regularly in fractional leap seconds so that utc approximated afterward these adjustments were made only in whole seconds to approximate this was a compromise arrangement in order to enable a publicly broadcast time the less frequent adjustments meant that the time scale would be more stable and easier to synchronize internationally the fact that it continues to approximate means that tasks such as navigation which require a source of universal time continue to be well served by the public broadcast of utc


































































































altruism is the moral principle and moral courage of concern for happiness of other human kind or other animals resulting in a quality of life both material and spirituality it is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews though the concept of others toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions in an extreme case altruism may become a synonym of selflessness which is the opposite of selfishness

the word altruism was coined by the french philosopher auguste comte in french as altruisme for an antonym of egoism he derived it from the italian altrui which in turn was derived from latin alteri meaning alterity or somebody else

altruism in biology observations in field populations of the day organisms is an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves eg pleasure and quality of life time probability of survival or reproduction but benefits either directly or indirectly another individual without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting that is intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards in one sense the opposite of altruism is spite a spiteful action harms another with no

altruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships altruism does not consider relationships much debate exists as to whether true altruism is possible in human psychology the theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification the validity of this argument depends on whether and extrinsic motivation qualify as benefits

the term altruism ethics may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others used in this sense it is usually contrasted with ethical egoism which claims individuals are morally obligated to serve themselves first effective altruism is the use of evidence and reason to determine the most effective ways to benefit others


the concept has a long history in philosophy and ethics thought the term was originally coined in the century by the founding sociologist and philosopher of science auguste comte and has become a major topic for psychologists especially evolutionary psychology researchers evolutionary biologists and ethology whilst ideas about altruism from one field can affect the other fields the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism in simple terms altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them




marcel mausss essay the gift essay contains a passage called note on alms this note describes the evolution of the notion of alms and by extension of altruism from the notion of sacrifice in it he writes

alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand and of a notion of sacrifice on the other generosity is an obligation because nemesis avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth of certain people who should rid themselves of it this is the ancient morality of the gift which has become a principle of justice the gods and the spirits accept that the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children




in the science of ethology the study of animal behaviour and more generally in the study of social evolution altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the fitness biology of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor in evolutionary psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity practice emergency aid help to coalition partners tip gratuity courtship gifts production of public good economicss and environmentalismpat barcaly the evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation in

theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from evolutionary game theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies




























such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their inclusive fitness when they are doing altruistic acts instead evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms such as emotions that promote altruistic behaviors

every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment this need not imply that on average or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits

the benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to to friends than to strangers to those attractive than to those unattractive to than to competitors and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup

the study of altruism was the initial impetus behind george r prices development of the price equation which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution an interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular slime moulds such as dictyostelid mucoroides these protists live as individual amoebae until starved at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body

selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds and associated emotional cognitive and neurohormonal mechanisms evolved in order to facilitate altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success

such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for politics such by the russian zoology and anarchism peter kropotkin in his book mutual aid a factor of evolution and ethics peter singer in his book a darwinian left


jorge moll and jordan grafman neuroscientists at the national institutes of health and hospital network jm provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging in their research published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences usa in october networks guide decisions about charitable donation pnas they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the mesolimbic pathway reward pathway a primitive part of the brain that usually responds to food and sex however when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations another brain circuit was selectively activated the subgenual region these structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species altruism the experiment suggested was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain and news















in fact in an experiment published in march at the university of southern california neuroscientist antonio r damasio and his colleagues showed that subjects with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lack the ability to empathically feel their way to moral answers and that when confronted with moral dilemmas these patients coldly came up with answers leading damasio to conclude that the point was not that they reached immoral conclusions but that when they were confronted by a difficult issue in this case as whether to shoot down a passenger plane hijacked by terrorists before it hits a major city these patients appear to reach decisions without the anguish that afflicts those with normally functioning brains according to adrian raine a clinical neuroscientist also at the university of southern california one of this studys implications is that society may have to rethink how it judges immoral people psychopaths often feel no empathy or remorse without that awareness people relying exclusively on reasoning seem to find it harder to sort their way through moral thickets does that mean they should be held to different standards of

in another study in the dr bill harbaugh a university of oregon economist concluded people are motivated to give for reasons of personal prestige and in a similar fmri scanner test in with his psychologist colleague dr ulrich mayr reached the same conclusions of jorge moll and jordan grafman about giving to charity although they were able to divide the study group into two groups egoists and altruists one of their discoveries was that though rarely even some of the considered egoists sometimes gave more than expected because that would help others leading to the conclusion that there are other factors in cause in charity such as a persons environment and values


the international encyclopedia of the social sciences defines psychological altruism as a motivational state with the goal of increasing anothers welfare psychological altruism is contrasted with psychological egoism which refers to the motivation to increase ones own welfare

there has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruismbatson c altruism in humans new york ny us oxford university press some definitions specify a nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors however because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question the social exchange theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits to the self outweigh costs to the self daniel batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory he identified four major motives to ultimately benefit the self egoism to ultimately benefit the other person altruism to benefit a group collectivism or to uphold a moral principle principlism altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism but the general conclusion has been that altruism can be genuinely selfless the hypothesis basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions people with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to anothers suffering helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues


in psychological research on altruism studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping behavior comforting sharing cooperation philanthropy and community service research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the persons distress research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping the bystander effect greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility however a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders

many studies have observed the effects of volunteering as a form of altruism on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and in a study of older adults those who volunteered were higher on life satisfaction and will to live and lower in depression mood anxiety mood and somatization volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health but physical health and longevity as well attributable to the activity and social integration it encourages one study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a period and found that of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only of those who did volunteer experienced one a study on adults ages found that during the study period people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a lower likelihood of dying after controlling for prior health status it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a reduction in mortality merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater a study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness it is important to note that while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness it has also been found to work in the opposite happier people are also kinder the relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states

studies have also been careful to note that feeling by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness for example one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one although positive effects were still significant additionally while generous acts make people feel good about themselves it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others studies suggest that gratitude goes with kindness and is also very important for our a study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals positive affect offering emotional support sleep quality and



sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society altruism morality and social solidarity american sociological association the structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable philanthropic and other altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field the american sociology association asa acknowledges public sociology saying the intrinsic scientific policy and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct good societies is unquestionable altruism morality and social solidarity asa this type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies how altruism is framed organized carried out and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and build the good society the motivation of altruism is also the focus of some publications link the occurrence of moral outrage to the punishment of perpetrators and compensation of victimsthulin ew bicchieri c im so angry i could help you moral outrage as a driver of victim compensation social philosophy policy studies have shown that generosity in laboratory and in online experiments is contagious people imitate observed generosity of others


pathological altruism is when altruism is taken to an unhealthy extreme and either harms the altruistic person or actions cause more harm than good

the term pathological altruism was popularised by the book pathological altruism

examples include depression mood and burnout seen in healthcare professionals an unhealthy focus on others to the detriment of ones own needs hoarding of animals and ineffective philanthropic and social programs that ultimately worsen the situations they are meant to aid



most if not all of the worlds religions promote altruism as a very important moral value buddhism christianity hinduism islam jainism judaism and sikhism etc place particular emphasis on altruistic morality



altruism figures prominently in buddhism love and compassion are components of all forms of buddhism and are focused on all beings equally love is the wish that all beings be happy and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion these qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness and the need for them lies at the very core of our being dalai lama speech by the dalai lama the phrase core of our being is see

still the notion of altruism is modified in such a since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness the more we care for the happiness of others the greater our own sense of becomes dalai lama

in the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative unhappy consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment but from the law of karma which functions like a natural law of cause and effect a simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what one causes if one causes suffering then as a natural consequence one would experience if one causes happiness then as a natural consequence one would experience happiness




the fundamental principles of jainism revolve around the concept of altruism not only for humans but for all sentient beings jainism preaches the view of ahimsa to live and let live thereby not harming sentient beings ie uncompromising reverence for all life it also considers all living things to be equal the first tirthankara rishabhdev introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation giving oneself up for others and compassion for all living things

jainism prescribes a path of to progress the soul to this ultimate goal a major characteristic of jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors ones unconquered mind with anger pride ego deceit greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans anger spoils good relations pride destroys humility deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness pride by humility deceit by straightforwardness and greed by contentment

jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation one must practice the following ethical principles major vows in thought speech and action the degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks they are





the great vows mahavrata are prescribed for monks and limited vows anuvrata are prescribed for householders the are encouraged to practice the five vows the monks have to observe them very strictly with consistent practice it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually accelerating the spiritual progress

the principle of nonviolence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul jainism views every soul jainism as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become siddha god in jainism because all living beings possess a soul great care and awareness is essential in ones actions jainism emphasizes the equality of all life advocating harmlessness towards all whether the creatures are great or small this policy extends even to microscopic organisms jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders


altruism is central to the teachings of jesus found in the gospel especially in the sermon on the mount and the sermon on the plain from biblical to medieval christian traditions tensions between and were sometimes discussed under the heading of disinterested love as in the paul the apostle phrase love seeks not its own interests in his book indoctrination and roderick hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic and altruism by analysis of within creative individuation of the self and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many love confirms others in their freedom shuns propaganda and masks assures others of its presence and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others but by each persons experience and practice from within as in practical arts the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone but in the making of the connection

st thomas aquinas interprets you should love your neighbour as yourselfleviticus and matthew as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for otherssumma theologica iiii quaestio article considering that the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship and quotes aristotle that the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselvesnicomachean ethics he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves we naturally seek the common good the good of the whole more than any private good the good of a part however he thinks we should love god more than ourselves and our neighbours and more than our bodily the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitudes a more desirable thing than bodily well being in coining the word altruism as stated above auguste comte was probably opposing this thomistic doctrine which is present in some theological schools within catholicism

many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of god john states that for one to love god one must love his fellowman and that hatred of ones fellowman is the same as hatred of god thomas jay oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love an altruistic action is not always a loving action oord defines altruism as acting for the others good and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for ones own good when the others demands undermine overall

german philosopher max scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak one way is a sincere expression of christian love motivated by a powerful feeling of security strength and inner salvation of the invincible fullness of ones own life and existence another way is merely one of the many modern substitutes for nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other peoples business at its worst scheler says love for the small the poor the weak and the oppressed is really disguised hatred repressed envy an impulse to detract etc directed against the opposite phenomena wealth strength power largesse



in islam the concept altruism is the notion of preferring others to oneself for sufism this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of ones own concerns where concern for others is deemed as a demand made by allah ie god on the human body considered to be property of allah alone the importance of lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater islam considers those practicing as abiding by the highest degree of nobility
this is similar to the notion of chivalry but unlike that european concept in attention is focused on everything in existence a constant concern for allah results in a careful attitude towards people animals and other things in this world
this concept was emphasized by sufis like rabia who paid attention to the difference between dedication to allah and dedication to people turkish sufi poet yunus emre explained this philosophy as severiz yaratandan that is we love the creature because of the creator for many muslims must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific islamic holidays however is also still an islamic ideal to which all muslims should strive to adhere at all times


judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation the famous rabbi abraham isaac kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity this is defined as tzedakah or giving which is the intention of altruism this can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or god kabbalah defines god as the force of giving in existence rabbi moshe chaim luzzatto in particular focused on the purpose of creation and how the will of god was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force

modern kabbalah developed by rabbi yehuda ashlag in his writings about the future generation focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism love for one another ashlag focused on society and its relation to divinity


altruism is essential to the sikhism religion the central faith in sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love affection sacrifice patience harmony truthfulness the concept of seva or selfless service to the community for its own sake is an important concept in sikhism

the fifth guru arjun dev sacrificed his life to uphold carats of pure truth the greatest gift to humanity the guru granth the ninth guru tegh bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity

in the late seventeenth century guru gobind singh the tenth guru in sikhism was at war with the mughal empire rulers to protect the people of different faiths when a fellow sikh bhai kanhaiya attended the troops of the enemy he gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield some of the enemy began to fight again and some sikh warriors were annoyed by bhai kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy sikh soldiers brought bhai kanhaiya before guru gobind singh and complained of his action that they considered counterproductive to their struggle on the battlefield what were you doing and asked the guru i was giving water to the wounded because i saw your face in all of them replied bhai kanhaiya the guru responded then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds you were practicing what you were coached in the house of the guru

under the tutelage of the guru bhai kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism which is still engaged today in doing good to others and in training new recruits for this service


in hinduism selflessness atmatyag love prema kindness daya and forgiveness kshama are considered as the highest acts of humanity or manushyattva giving alms to the beggers or poor people is considered as a divine act or punya and hindus believe it will free their souls from guilt or paapa and will led them to heaven or swarga in afterlife altruism is also the central act of various hindu mythology and religious poems and songs

swami vivekananda the legendary hindu monk has said prem kare jeijon seijon sebiche iswar whoever loves any living being is serving god mass donation of clothes to poor people vastraseva or blood donation camp or mass food donation annaseva for poor people is common in various hindu religious ceremonies

swami sivananda an advaita scholar reiterates the views in his commentary synthesising vedanta views on the brahma sutras a vedantic text in his commentary on chapter of the brahma sutras sivananda notes that karma is insentient and and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed hence karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to ones merit furthermore one cannot argue that karma generates apurva or merit buddhism which gives fruit since apurva is it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god it cannot independently bestow reward or punishment

however the very well known and popular text the bhagavad gita supports the doctrine of karma yoga achieving oneness with god through action nishkam karma or action without expectation desire for personal gain which can be said to encompass altruism altruistic acts are generally celebrated and very well received in hindu literature and is central to hindu moralitysivananda swami phaladhikaranam topic sutras




there exists a wide range of philosophical views on humans obligations or motivations to act altruistically proponents of altruism ethics maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically the opposing view is ethical egoism which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with utilitarianism which maintains that each agent should act in order to maximise the efficacy of their function and the benefit to both themselves and their

by this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be rand possibly because it is graphically similar to a vowelless excerpt of her birth surname in cyrillic and she adopted the first name ayn either from a finnic languages name aino given name or from the hebrew word ayin meaning said the origin of ayn was finnish but some biographical sources question this suggesting it may come from a hebrew

rands first published novel the we the living was published in set in soviet russia it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state in a foreword to the novel rand stated that we the living is as near to an autobiography as i will ever write it is not an autobiography in the literal but only in the intellectual sense the plot is invented the background is not initial sales were slow and the american publisher let it go out of print although european editions continued to sellralston richard e publishing we the living in after the success of her later novels rand was able to release a revised version in that has since sold over three million copiesralston richard e publishing we the living in in without rands knowledge or permission the novel was made into a pair of italian films noi vivi and addio kira rediscovered in the these films were into a new version which was approved by rand and as we the living film in

her novella anthem novella was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel the fountainhead it presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word i has been forgotten and replaced with it was published in england in but rand initially could not find an american publisher as with we the living rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in which has sold more than copiesralston richard e publishing anthem in



during the rand became politically active she and her husband worked as volunteers for the presidential campaign of republican wendell willkie this work led to rands first public speaking she enjoyed fielding sometimes hostile questions from new york city audiences who had viewed newsreels this activity brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to capitalism she became friends with journalist henry hazlitt and his wife and hazlitt introduced her to the austrian school economist ludwig von mises despite her philosophical differences with them rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and both of them expressed admiration for her mises once referred to rand as the most courageous man in america a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said man instead of rand also became friends with libertarian writer isabel paterson rand questioned paterson about american history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave paterson ideas for her only book the god of the machine



rands first major success as a writer came in with the fountainhead a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years the novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named howard roark and his struggle against what rand described as who attempt to live through others placing others above themselves it was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the company on the insistence of editor archibald ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it while completing the novel rand was prescribed the amphetamine benzedrine to fight fatigue the drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood

the fountainhead became a worldwide success bringing rand fame and financial in rand sold the rights for a the fountainhead film to warner bros and she returned to hollywood to write the screenplay finishing her work on that screenplay she was hired by producer hal b wallis as a screenwriter and her work for wallis included the screenplays for the academy love letters film and you came rand also worked on other projects including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called the moral basis of individualism although the planned book was never completed a condensed version was published as an essay titled the only path to tomorrow in the january edition of readers digest


rand extended her involvement with and activism while working in hollywood she became involved with the motion picture alliance for the preservation of american ideals a hollywood group and wrote articles on the groups behalf she also joined the american writers association a visit by isabel paterson to meet with rands california associates led to a final falling out between the two when paterson made comments which rand considered rude to valued political in during the second red scare rand testified as a friendly witness before the united states house activities committee her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the soviet union and the portrayal of it in the film song of russia rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the soviet union portraying life there as much better and happier than it actually was she wanted to also criticize the lauded film the best years of our lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but she was not allowed to testify about it when asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations rand described the process as futile

after several delays the film version of the fountainhead was released in although it used rands screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end and complained about its editing acting and other elements




in the years following the publication of the fountainhead rand received numerous letters from readers some of whom the book profoundly influenced in rand moved from los angeles to new york city where she gathered a group of these admirers around her this group jokingly designated the collective included future chair of the federal reserve alan greenspan a young psychology student named nathan blumenthal later nathaniel branden and his wife barbara branden and barbaras cousin leonard peikoff initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy she later began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel atlas shrugged as the manuscript pages were written in rands close relationship with the younger nathaniel branden turned into a romantic affair with the grudging consent of their spouses

atlas shrugged published in was considered rands rand described the theme of the novel as the role of the mind in mans as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational gregory atlas shrugged on the role of the mind in mans existence in it advocates the core tenets of rands philosophy of objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement the plot involves a dystopian united states in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike action and retreating to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy the novels hero and leader of the strike john galt describes the strike as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nations wealth and achievement with this fictional strike rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive the economy would collapse and society would fall apart the novel includes elements of mystery fiction romance and science fiction and it contains an extended exposition of objectivism in the form of a lengthy monologue delivered by galtstolyarov ii g the role and essence of john galts speech in ayn rands atlas shrugged in



despite many negative reviews atlas shrugged became an international bestseller in an interview with mike wallace rand declared herself the most creative thinker alive however rand was discouraged and depressed by the reaction of intellectuals to the atlas shrugged was rands last completed work of it marked the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular
in nathaniel branden established nathaniel branden lectures later incorporated as the nathaniel branden institute nbi to promote rands philosophy collective members gave lectures for nbi and wrote articles for objectivist periodicals that she edited rand later published some of these articles in book form

critics including some former nbi students and branden himself later described the culture of nbi as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for rand with some describing nbi or the objectivist movement itself as a cult or rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair and some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers however some former nbi students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated and the problem was concentrated among rands closest followers in new rand was unimpressed with many of the nbi students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with


throughout the and rand developed and promoted her objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as yale princeton university columbia university harvard and the massachusetts institute of technology she received an honorary degree doctor of humane letters from lewis clark college on october she also began delivering annual lectures at the ford hall forum responding afterward to questions from the audience during these speeches and qa sessions she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day these included supporting abortion rights opposing the vietnam war and the military draft but condemning many draft dodgers as supporting israel in the yom kippur war of against a coalition of arab nations as civilized men fighting saying european colonization of the americas had the right to develop land taken from indigenous peoples of the and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it she also endorsed several republican party united states candidates for president of the united states most strongly barry goldwater in united states presidential election whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for the objectivist


in nathaniel branden began an affair with the young actress patrecia scott whom he later married nathaniel and barbara branden kept the affair hidden from rand when she learned of it in though her romantic relationship with branden had already ended rand terminated her relationship with both brandens which led to the closure of nbi rand published an article in the objectivist repudiating nathaniel branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life in subsequent years rand and several more of her closest associates parted company

rand underwent surgery for lung cancer in after decades of heavy smoking in she retired from writing her newsletter and after her initial objections she allowed social worker evva pryor an employee of her attorney to enroll her in social security united states and medicare united states during the late her activities within the objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on november one of her final projects was work on a television adaptation of atlas shrugged

rand died of heart failure on march at her home in new york city and was interred in the kensico cemetery valhalla new york rands funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers including alan greenspan a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket in her will rand named leonard peikoff to inherit her estate






rand called her philosophy objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute she considered objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and

in metaphysics rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religionden uyl douglas j rasmussen douglas b ayn rands realism in

in epistemology she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses she rejected all claims of or a priori and a posteriori knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing in her introduction to objectivist epistemology rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the

in ethics rand argued for rational egoism and ethical egoism rational as the guiding moral principle she said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself she referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her the virtue of selfishness in which she presented her solution to the problem by describing a theory that based morality in the needs of mans survival qua she condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held that the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in atlas shrugged that force and mind are

rands political philosophy emphasized individual rights including private property and she considered capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights she opposed statism which she understood to include theocracy absolute monarchy nazism fascism communism democratic socialism and dictatorship rand believed that natural rights should be protected by a constitutionally limited government although her political views are often classified as conservatism in the united states or libertarian she preferred the term radical for capitalism she worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and she denounced libertarianism which she associated with she rejected anarchism as a theory based in subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in

in aesthetics rand defined art as a selective of reality according to an artists metaphysical according to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness as a writer the art form rand focused on most closely was literature where she considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will she described her own approach to literature as romantic

rand acknowledged aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three thomas aquinas and ayn rand in a interview with mike wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me i devised the rest of my philosophy myself however she also found early inspiration in friedrich and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from rands in passages from the first edition of we the living which rand later valerie ayn rand and feminist synthesis rereading we the living in and in her overall writing sheaffer robert rereading rand on gender in the light of paglia in however by the time she wrote the fountainhead rand had turned against nietzsches and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is mayhew robert we the living and in

rand considered her philosophical opposite to be immanuel kant whom she referred to as the most evil man in mankinds history primarily for his philosophy regarding the limitations of reason

rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her theory of concepts ethics and discovery in politics that violation of of the initiation of force she believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy stating i am not primarily an advocate of capitalism but of and i am not primarily an advocate of egoism but of reason if one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently all the rest follows





during rands lifetime her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation rands first novel we the living was admired by the literary critic h l ralston richard e publishing we the living in her broadway play night of january was both a critical and popular success and the fountainhead was hailed by the new york times reviewer lorine pruette as masterful reprinted in rands novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic however they became bestsellers largely through word of

the first reviews rand received were for night of january reviews of the production were largely positive but rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer rand believed that her first novel we the living was not widely reviewed but rand scholar michael s berliner writes it was the most reviewed of any of her works with approximately different reviews being published in more than publications overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later workberliner michael s reviews of we the living in her novella anthem received little attention from reviewers both for its first publication in england and for subsequent michael s reviews of anthem in

rands first bestseller the fountainhead received far fewer reviews than we the living and reviewers opinions were mixedberliner michael s the fountainhead reviews in lorine pruettes positive review in the new york times was one that rand greatly appreciated pruette called rand a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly and stated that you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time there were other positive reviews but rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel such as one that called it a whale of a book and another that said anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and rands style offensively pedestrian

rands novel atlas shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negativeberliner michael s the atlas shrugged reviews in in national review conservative author whittaker chambers called the book sophomoric and remarkably silly he described the tone of the book as shrillness without reprieve and accused rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of the religion in the soviet union claiming from almost any page of atlas shrugged a voice can be heard from painful necessity commanding to a gas atlas shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications including praise from the noted book reviewer john chamberlain journalist but rand scholar mimi reisel gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest calling it execrable claptrap and a also said it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity

rands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had the tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book for the new intellectual was similar to that for atlas shrugged with philosopher sidney hook likening her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the soviet union and author gore vidal calling her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality reprinted from esquire magazine july her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers

in on the anniversary of rands birth edward rothstein writing for the new york times referred to her fictional writing as quaint utopian retro fantasy and programmatic of the misunderstood artist while criticizing her characters isolated rejection of democratic society in book critic leslie clark described her fiction as romance novels with a patina of in critic columnist tom carson described her books as capitalisms version of middlebrow religious novels such as a tale of the christ and the left behind series reviewing the posthumously published novel ideal novel the new york times chief book critic michiko kakutani assessed rands didactic ideological work as stylistically having a great deal in common with the socialist realism produced in the soviet union which she left in the and vociferously denounced



in a survey conducted for the library of congress and the club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondents life was rands atlas shrugged was the second most popular choice after the bible rands books continue to be widely sold and read with over copies sold with about of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the ayn rand institute in modern library readers voted atlas shrugged the centurys finest work of fiction followed by the fountainhead in second place anthem in seventh and we the living none of the four appeared on the critics list although rands influence has been greatest in the united states there has been international interest in her

rands contemporary admirers included fellow novelists such as ira levin kay nolte smith and l neil and later writers such as erika holzer and terry goodkind have been influenced by her other artists who have cited rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include comic book artist steve ditko and musician neil peart of rush band although he later distanced himself rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work john a allison iv of bbt and ed snider of comcast spectacor have funded the promotion of rands while mark cuban owner of the dallas mavericks as well as john p mackey ceo of whole foods among others have said they consider rand crucial to their success

rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media on television shows including animated sitcoms comedies dramas and game shows as well as in movies and video games she or a character based on her figures prominently in positive and negative lights in literary and science fiction novels by prominent american authors one such depiction is found in the character anna granite with her philosophy of definitivism in mary gaitskills novel two girls fat and thin nick gillespie editor in chief of reason magazine has remarked that rands is a tortured immortality one in which shes as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist and that jibes at rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture two movies have been made about rands life a documentary film ayn rand a sense of life was nominated for the academy award for best documentary feature the passion of ayn rand film a television adaptation of the the passion of ayn rand book won several awards rands image also appears on a list of people on stamps of the united postage stamps and postal history of the united states illustrated by artist nick gaetano a satirical film by artist and scholar zach blas called jubilee exhibited primarily in art galleries and museums features a young ayn rand and alan greenspan traveling through time to visit a dystopian silicon valley whose success and ruin is attributed to rands technologist followers such as peter thiel



although she rejected the labels conservative and rand has had continuing influence on politics and libertarianism jim powell historian a senior fellow at the cato institute considers rand one of the three most important women along with rose wilder lane and isabel paterson of modern american libertarianism and david nolan libertarian one of the founders of the libertarian party united states stated that without ayn rand the libertarian movement would not exist in his history of the libertarian movement journalist brian doherty journalist described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large and biographer jennifer burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right economist and ayn rand student george reisman wrote ayn randin particular must be cited as providing a philosophical foundation for the case of capitalism and as being responsible probably more than anyone else for the current spread of ideas


she faced intense opposition from william f buckley jr and other contributors for the national review magazine they published numerous criticisms in the and by whittaker chambers garry wills and m stanton evans nevertheless her influence among conservatives forced buckley and other national review contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism

the political figures who cite rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the republican party despite rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives such as being and an atheist a article in the new york times referred to her as the presidency of ronald reagans novelist laureate republican united states congress and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her

the financial crisis of spurred renewed interest in her works especially atlas shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the opinion articles compared events with the plot of the during this time signs mentioning rand and her fictional hero john galt appeared at tea party protests there was also increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of rational rand and free markets particularly through her influence on alan greenspan for example mother jones magazine remarked that rands particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy the talented and the powerful as the oppressed while equating randian individual with that of the volk according to goebbels corey robin of the nation alleged similarities between the moral syntax of randianism and fascism




during rands lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars when the first academic book about rands philosophy appeared in its author declared writing about rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously a few articles about rands ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in many of them in the personalist one of these was on the randian argument by libertarian philosopher robert nozick who argued that her argument is unsound and fails to solve the problem posed by david hume other philosophers writing in the same publication argued that nozick misstated rands case academic consideration of rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited academic mimi gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about rands novels when she began researching her in and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the


since rands death interest in her work has gradually in historian jennifer burns writer identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in rand including an explosion of scholarship since the year however as of that same year few universities included rand or objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study

writing in the edition of the routledge encyclopedia of philosophy political theorist chandran kukathas summarizes the mainstream philosophical reception to her work in two parts her ethical argument he says is viewed by most commentators as an unconvincing variant of aristotles ethics her political theory he says is of little interest marred by an out and unsystematic effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism libertarian philosopher michael huemer argues that very few people find rands ideas convincing especially her ethics which he believes are difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence he attributes the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist noting that atlas shrugged outsells rands works as well as the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism such as ludwig von mises friedrich hayek or frederic bastiat

several critics claim that the novel what is to be novel by russian author nikolay chernyshevsky is an embodiment of rational egoism and one of the sources of inspiration for rands thought for example the books main character lopuhov says i am not a man to make sacrifices and indeed there are no such things one acts in the way that one finds most pleasant

regarding rands particular disdain for the philosophy of immanuel kant philosophers george walsh and fred seddon have argued that she misinterpreted kant and exaggerated their differences

political scientist charles murray political scientist while praising rands literary accomplishments criticizes her claim that her only philosophical debt was to aristotle instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as john locke and friedrich nietzsche although rand maintained that objectivism was an integrated philosophical system philosopher robert h bass argues that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas

in the the literary encyclopedia english entry for rand written in john david lewis declared that rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation


some scholars focus specifically on rands work in allan gotthelf george walsh and david kelley the ayn rand society a group affiliated with the american philosophical gladstein harry binswanger allan gotthelf john hospers edwin a locke wallace matson leonard peikoff chris matthew sciabarra and tara smith philosopher have taught her work in academic institutions sciabarra the journal of ayn rand studies a nonpartisan journal dedicated to the study of rands philosophical and literary work in a interview in the chronicle of higher education sciabarra commented i know they laugh at rand while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community

in the university of pittsburgh press launched an ayn rand society philosophical studies series based on the proceedings of the society smith has written several academic books and papers on rands ideas including ayn rands normative ethics the virtuous egoist a volume on rands ethical theory published by cambridge university press rands ideas have also been made subjects of study at clemson university and duke university universities scholars of english and american literature have largely ignored her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the

rand scholars douglas den uyl and douglas b rasmussen while stressing the importance and originality of her thought describe her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional political writer and rand scholar jack wheeler writes that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of randian rage rands ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thoughtwheeler jack rand and aristotle in



in rands intellectual heir leonard peikoff established the ayn rand institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting rands ideas and works in after an ideological disagreement with peikoff philosopher david kelley founded the institute for objectivist studies now known as the atlas in historian john mccaskey organized the anthem foundation for objectivist scholarship which provides grants for scholarly work on objectivism in academia the charitable foundation of bbt corporation has also given grants for teaching rands ideas or works the university of texas at austin the university of pittsburgh and university of north carolina at chapel hill are among the schools that have received grants in some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to

in the region of ain hanech province early remnants bc of hominid occupation in north africa were found neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the levallois technique and mousterian styles bc similar to those in the levant algeria was the site of the highest state of development of middle paleolithic flake tool techniques tools of this era starting about bc are called aterian after the archaeological site of bir el ater south of

the earliest blade industries in north africa are called iberomaurusian located mainly in the oran region this industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the maghreb between and bc neolithic civilization animal domestication and agriculture developed in the saharan and mediterranean maghreb perhaps as early as bc or as late as between and bc this life richly depicted in the tassili najjer paintings predominated in algeria until the classical period the mixture of peoples of north africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called berber people who are the indigenous peoples of northern africa



from their principal center of power at carthage the carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the north african by bc a phoenician presence existed at tipasa east of cherchell hippo regius modern annaba and rusicade modern skikda these settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages

as carthaginian power grew its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically berber civilisation was already at a stage in which agriculture manufacturing trade and political organisation supported several states trade links between carthage and the berbers in the interior grew but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others


by the early century bc berbers formed the single largest element of the carthaginian army in the mercenary war berber soldiers rebelled from to bc after being unpaid following the defeat of carthage in the first punic war they succeeded in obtaining control of much of carthages north african territory and they minted coins bearing the name libyan used in greek to describe natives of north africa the carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the romans in the punic wars

in bc the city of carthage was destroyed as carthaginian power waned the influence of berber leaders in the hinterland grew by the century bc several large but loosely administered berber kingdoms had emerged two of them were established in numidia behind the coastal areas controlled by carthage west of numidia lay mauretania which extended across the moulouya river in morocco to the atlantic ocean the high point of berber civilisation unequalled until the coming of the almohads and almoravids more than a millennium later was reached during the reign of masinissa in the century bc

after masinissas death in bc the berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times masinissas line survived until ad when the remaining berber territory was annexed to the roman empire

for several centuries algeria was ruled by the romans who founded many colonies in the region like the rest of north africa algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire exporting cereals and other agricultural products augustine of hippo was the bishop of hippo regius annaba algeria located in the roman province of africa roman province the germanic vandals of geiseric moved into north africa in and by controlled coastal numidia they did not make any significant settlement on the land as they were harassed by local tribes in fact by the time the byzantines arrived leptis magna was abandoned and the msellata region was occupied by the indigenous amazigh who had been busy facilitating an amazigh political military and cultural revival furthermore during the rule of the romans byzantines vandals and carthaginians the kabyle people were the only or one of the few in north africa who remained independent the middle east and north africa pg sketches of algeria during the kabyle war by hugh mulleneux walmsley pg the kabyle people by glora m wysner the encyclopedia americana volume pg the kabyle people were incredibly resistible so much so that even during the arab conquest of north africa they still had control and possession over their mountains the art journal london volume pg the barbary coast by henry martyn field pg





after negligible resistance from the locals muslims arabs of the umayyad caliphate conquered algeria in the early century of dyhia in khenchela
dihya memorial in khenchela large numbers of the indigenous berber people converted to islam christians berber and latin speakers remained in the great majority in tunisia until the end of the century and muslims only became a vast majority some time in the conant staying roman pp after the fall of the umayyad caliphate numerous local dynasties emerged including the rustamids aghlabids fatimids zirids hammadids almoravids almohads and the abdalwadid the christians left in three waves after the initial conquest in the century and the the last were evacuated to sicily by the normans and the few remaining died out in the century

during the middle ages north africa was home to many great scholars saints and sovereigns including judah ibn kuraish the first grammarian to mention semitic and berber languages the great sufi masters abu madyan and sidi el houari and the emirs abd and yaghmurasen ibn zyan it was during this time that the fatimids or children of fatima daughter of muhammad came to the maghreb these fatimids went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the maghreb hejaz and the levant boasting a secular inner government as well as a powerful army and navy made up primarily of arabs and levantines extending from algeria to their capital state of cairo the fatimid caliphate began to collapse when its governors the zirids seceded in order to punish them the fatimids sent the arab banu hilal and banu sulaym against them the resultant war is recounted in the epic taghribat bani hilal in the amazigh zirid hero khalifa asks daily for duels to defeat the hilalan hero abu zayd and many other arab knights in a string of victories the zirids however were ultimately defeated ushering in an adoption of arab customs and culture the indigenous berber people tribes however remained largely independent and depending on tribe location and time controlled varying parts of the maghreb at times unifying it as under the fatimids the fatimid islamic state also known as fatimid caliphate made an islamic empire that included north africa sicily palestine region jordan lebanon syria egypt the red sea coast of africa tihamah hejaz and yemen caliphates from northern africa traded with the other empires of their time as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other islamic states during the islamic era



the berber people historically consisted of several tribes the two main branches were the botr and tribes who were divided into tribes and again into each region of the maghreb contained several tribes for example sanhadja houara zenata masmuda kutama awarba and berghwata all these tribes made independent territorial decisions

several berber people dynasties emerged during the middle ages in the maghreb and other nearby lands ibn khaldun provides a table summarising the amazigh dynasties of the maghreb region the zirid dynasty banu ifran maghrawa almoravid hammadid almohad merinid zayyanid dynasty wattasid meknassa and hafsid dynasties both of the hammadid and zirid empires as well as the fatimids established their rule in all of the maghreb countries the zirid dynasty ruled land in what is now algeria tunisia morocco libya spain malta and italy the hammadid dynasty captured and held important regions such as ouargla constantine sfax susa algiers tripoli and fez establishing their rule in every country in the maghreb region saladin the almohads and the the contest for north africa pg islam art and architecture pg historical dictionary of the berbers imazighen pg the fatimid caliphate which was created and established by the kutama berbers african foreign policy and diplomacy from antiquity to the century volume pg an atlas of african historyhistory by j d fagefage pg conquered all of north africa as well as sicily and parts of the middle east
















there reigned in ifriqiya current tunisia a berbers family zirid dynasty somehow recognising the suzerainty of the fatimid caliphate caliph of cairo probably in the zirid ruler or viceroy decided to end this suzerainty the fatimid state was too weak to attempt a punitive the viceroy also found another means of revenge

between the nile and the red sea were living bedouin tribes expelled from arabia for their disruption and turbulent influence both banu hilal and banu sulaym among others whose presence disrupted farmers in the nile valley since the nomads would often loot the then fatimid caliphate vizier devised to relinquish control of the maghreb and obtained the agreement of his sovereign this not only prompted the bedouins to leave but the fatimid treasury even gave them a light expatriation cash allowance

whole tribes set off with women children ancestors animals and camping equipment some stopped on the way especially in cyrenaica where they are still one of the essential elements of the settlement but most arrived in ifriqiya by the governorates region the zirid ruler tried to stop this rising tide but with each encounter the last under the walls of kairouan his troops were defeated and the arabs remained masters of the field

the flood was still rising and in the arabs spread on the high plains of constantine algeria where they gradually choked beni hammad fort as they had done in kairouan a few decades ago from there they gradually gained the upper algiers and oran plains some were forcibly taken by the almohads in the second half of the century we can say that in the century the arabs were in all of north africa with the exception of the main mountain ranges and certain coastal regions which remained entirely berber the influx of bedouin tribes was a major factor in the linguistic cultural arabization of the maghreb and in the spread of nomadism in areas where agriculture had previously been dominant ibn khaldun noted that the lands ravaged by banu hilal tribes had become completely arid desert populations crises and population cycles claire russell and w m s russell

in the early century spain constructed fortified outposts presidios on or near the algerian coast spain took control of few coastal towns like mers el kebir in oran in and tlemcen mostaganem and in in the same year a few merchants of algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbour to spain which built a fort on it the presidios in north africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavour that did not guarantee access for spains merchant fleet





the region of algeria was partially ruled by ottomans for three centuries from to in the turkish people privateer brothers aruj and hayreddin barbarossa who operated successfully under the hafsids moved their base of operations to algiers they succeeded in conquering jijel and algiers from the spain but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region forcing the previous ruler abu hamo musa iii of the bani ziyad dynasty to flee when aruj was killed in during his invasion of kingdom of tlemcen hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of algiers the ottoman empire sultan gave him the title of beylerbey and a contingent of some janissaries with the aid of this force hayreddin barbarossa conquered the whole area between constantine and oran although the city of oran remained in spanish hands until



the next beylerbey was hayreddins son hasan pasha son of barbarossa who assumed the position in until the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits subsequently with the institution of a regular ottoman administration governors with the title of pasha ruled for terms the pasha was assisted by janissaries known in algeria as the ojaq and led by an agha ottoman empire discontent among the ojaq rose in the because they were not paid regularly and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha as a result the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in

plague disease had repeatedly struck the cities of north africa algiers lost from to inhabitants to the plague in and suffered high fatalities in and

in the taifa rebelled killed the agha and placed one of its own in power the new leader received the title of dey after the right to select the dey passed to the divan a council of some sixty nobles it was at first dominated by the but by the century it had become the deys instrument in the dey persuaded the sultan to recognise him and his successors as regent replacing the pasha in that role although algiers remained a part of the ottoman empire

the dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat the dey was elected for a life term but in the years that the system survived fourteen of the deys were assassinated despite usurpation military coups and occasional mob rule the operation of ottoman government was remarkably orderly although the regency patronised the tribal chieftains it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest autonomous tribal states were tolerated and the regencys authority was seldom applied in the kabylie

the barbary pirates preyed on christian and other shipping in the western mediterranean sea the pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as slavery they also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives according to robert davis from the to century pirates captured million to million europeans as slaves they often made raids called ghazi warrior on european coastal towns to capture christian slaves to sell at slavery in the ottoman empire in north africa and other parts of the ottoman empire in for example hayreddin barbarossa captured the island of ischia taking prisoners and enslaved some inhabitants of lipari almost the entire population in the ottoman governor of algiers turgut reis enslaved the entire population of the malta island of gozo barbary pirates often attacked the balearic islands the threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of formentera the introduction of ships from the beginning of the century allowed them to branch out into the atlantic

barbary raids in the mediterranean continued to attack spanish merchant shipping and as a result the spanish navy bombarded algiers in bombardment of algiers and bombardment of algiers for the attack in the spanish fleet was to be joined by ships from such traditional enemies of algiers as kingdom of naples kingdom of portugal and the knights hospitaller over cannonballs were fired much of the city and its fortifications were destroyed and most of the algerian fleet was sunk

from until independence france administered the whole mediterranean region of algeria as an integral part and of the nation one of frances overseas territories algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of european ethnic groups immigrants who became known as colons and later as between and french people emigrated to algeria these settlers benefited from the french governments confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land many europeans settled in oran and algiers and by the early century they formed a majority of the population in both citiesalbert habib hourani malise ruthven a history of the arab peoples harvard university press



during the late and early the white africans of european ancestry was almost a fifth of the population the french government aimed at making algeria an assimilated part of france and this included substantial educational investments especially after the indigenous cultural and religious resistance heavily opposed this tendency but in contrast to the other colonised countries path in central asia and caucasus algeria kept its individual skills and a relatively intensive agriculture

during the world war ii algeria came under vichy france before being liberated by the allies of world war ii in operation torch which saw the first deployment of military history of the united states during world war ii in the north african campaign

gradually dissatisfaction among the muslim population which lacked political and economic status under the colonial system gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy and eventually independence from france in may the uprising against the occupying french forces was suppressed through what is now known as the and guelma massacre tensions between the two population groups came to a head in when the first violent events of what was later called the algerian war began after the publication of the declaration of november historians have estimated that between and harkis and their dependants were killed by the national liberation front algeria fln or by lynching mobs in algeria the fln used hit and run attacks in algeria and france as part of its war and the french conducted torture during the algerian war of independence

the war led to the death of hundreds of thousands of algerians and hundreds of thousands of injuries historians like alistair horne and raymond aron state that the actual number of algerian muslim war dead was far greater than the original fln and official french estimates but was less than the deaths claimed by the algerian government after independence horne estimated algerian casualties during the span of eight years to be around the war uprooted more than algerians

the war against french rule concluded in when algeria gained complete independence following the march evian agreements and the july algerian referendum some estimates put the algerian death toll during the french colonial rule at over million



the number of european who fled algeria totaled more than between and the exodus to mainland france accelerated after the oran massacre of in which hundreds of militants entered european sections of the city and began attacking civilians



algerias first president was the front de nationale fln leader ahmed ben bella moroccos claim to greater morocco led to the sand war in ben bella was algerian coup by houari his former ally and defence minister under ben bella the government had become increasingly socialist and continued this trend but he relied much more on the army for his support and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role he collective farming agriculture and launched a massive industrialisation drive extraction of petroleum facilities were nationalised this was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international oil crisis

in the and under president houari boumediene algeria pursued a program of industrialisation within a socialist economy boumedienes successor chadli bendjedid introduced some liberal economic reforms he promoted a policy of arabisation in algerian society and public life teachers of arabic brought in from other muslim countries spread conventional islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of a return to orthodox islam

the algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the oil glut economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in algerian social unrest during the by the end of the decade bendjedid introduced a system political parties developed such as the islamic salvation front fis a broad coalition of muslim groups




in december the islamic salvation front dominated the first of two rounds of algerian legislative election fearing the election of an islamist government the authorities intervened on january cancelling the elections bendjedid resigned and a high council of state algeria was installed to act as the presidency it banned the fis triggering a civil insurgency between the fronts armed wing the armed islamic group of algeria and the national armed forces in which more than people are thought to have died the islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of list of massacres during the algerian civil war die in one of algerian civil wars worst massacres the new york times august at several points in the conflict the situation in algeria became a point of international concern most notably during the crisis surrounding air france flight a hijacking perpetrated by the armed islamic group the armed islamic group declared a ceasefire in october

bouteflika was in the algerian presidential election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation the programme comprised economic institutional political and social reform to modernise the country raise living standards and tackle the causes of alienation it also included a second amnesty initiative the charter for peace and national reconciliation which was approved in a algerian national reconciliation referendum it offered amnesty to most guerrillas and government security forces

in november the algerian constitution was amended following a vote in parliament removing the limit on presidential incumbents this change enabled bouteflika to stand for in the algerian presidential election and he was in april during his election campaign and following his bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a spending programme to create three million new jobs the construction of one million new housing units and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes

a continuing series of protests throughout the country started on december inspired by similar arab spring on february the government lifted algerias state of emergency the government enacted legislation dealing with political parties the electoral code and the representation of women in elected bodies in april bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform however elections are routinely criticised by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue

elected politicians have relatively little sway over algeria instead a group of unelected civilian and military deciders known as le pouvoir the power actually rule the country even deciding who should be president the most powerful man might have been mohamed the head of military intelligence before he was brought down during the algerian protests in recent years many of these generals have died retired or been imprisoned after the death of general larbi belkheir previous president bouteflika put loyalists in key posts notably at sonatrach and secured constitutional amendments that made him indefinitely until he was brought down in during algerian protests

anthropology is the science of humanity concerned with human behavior human biology cultures and society in both the present and past including homo social anthropology studies patterns of behaviour while cultural anthropology studies cultural meaning including norms and values linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life biological anthropology studies the biological development of humans visual anthropology which is usually considered to be a part of social anthropology can mean both ethnographic film where photography film and new media are used for study as well as the study of visuals including art visual images cinema etc oxford bibliographies describes visual anthropology as the anthropological study of the visual and the visual study of the anthropological

archaeology which studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence is considered a branch of anthropology in the united states and canada while in europe it is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines such as history a key distinguishing factor between archeology and anthropology is the focus on analyzing material remains in vs archaeology vs anthropology august




the abstract noun wiktanthropology is first attested in reference to history its present use first appeared in german renaissance holy roman empire in the works of magnus hundt and otto casmann their new latin derived from the combining forms of the ancient greek words human and scienceoxford english dictionary ed anthropology n oxford university press oxford its adjectival form appeared in the works of aristotle it began to be used in english possibly via french language by the early century


in the bartholins founders of the university of copenhagen defined as follows

anthropology that is to say the science that treats of man is divided ordinarily and with reason into anatomy which considers the body and the parts and psychology which speaks of the soul

sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred subsequently such as the use by serres in to describe the natural history or paleontology of man based on comparative anatomy and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in at the national museum of natural history france by jean louis armand de quatrefages de various organizations of anthropologists had already been formed the ethnologique de paris the first to use ethnology was formed in its members were primarily activists when slavery was abolished in france in the was abandoned

meanwhile the ethnological society of new york currently the american ethnological society was founded on its model in as well as the ethnological society of london in a group of the aborigines protection society these anthropologists of the times were liberal and rights they maintained international connections

anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results of the comparative methods developed in the earlier century theorists in such diverse fields as comparative anatomy comparative method linguistics and ethnology making comparisons of their subject matters were beginning to suspect that similarities between animals languages and folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then for them the publication of charles darwins on the origin of species was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect anthropologists generally regard herodotus a greek historian who lived in the bc as the first thinker to write widely on concepts that would later become central to anthropology

darwin and wallace unveiled evolution in the late there was an immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences paul broca in paris was in the process of breaking away from the de biologie to form the first of the explicitly anthropological societies the society of anthropology of paris meeting for the first time in paris in book broca and the french school of anthropology saturday lectures delivered in the of the u s national museum under the auspices of the anthropological and biological societies of washington in march and april washington dc lothrop judd detweiler when he read darwin he became an immediate convert to transformisme as the french called evolutionism his definition now became the study of the human group considered as a whole in its details and in relation to the rest of nature

broca being what today would be called a neurosurgery had taken an interest in the pathology of speech he wanted to localize the difference between man and the other animals which appeared to reside in speech he discovered the speech center of the human brain today called brocas area after him his interest was mainly in biological anthropology but a german philosopher specializing in psychology theodor waitz took up the theme of general and social anthropology in his work entitled die anthropologie der the title was soon translated as the anthropology of primitive peoples the last two volumes were published posthumously

waitz defined anthropology as the science of the nature of man following brocas lead waitz points out that anthropology is a new field which would gather material from other fields but would differ from them in the use of comparative anatomy physiology and psychology to differentiate man from the animals nearest to him he stresses that the data of comparison must be empirical gathered by experimentation the history of civilization as well as ethnology are to be brought into the comparison it is to be presumed fundamentally that the species man is a unity and that the same laws of thought are applicable to all men

waitz was influential among the british ethnologists in the explorer richard francis burton and the speech therapist james hunt speech therapist broke away from the ethnological society of london to form the anthropological society of london which henceforward would follow the path of the new anthropology rather than just ethnology it was the society dedicated to general anthropology in existence representatives from the french were present though not broca in his keynote address printed in the first volume of its new publication the anthropological review hunt stressed the work of waitz adopting his definitions as a standard among the first associates were the young edward burnett tylor inventor of cultural anthropology and his brother alfred tylor a geologist previously edward had referred to himself as an subsequently an anthropologist

similar organizations in other countries followed the anthropological society of madrid the american anthropological association in the anthropological society of vienna the italian society of anthropology and ethnology and many others subsequently the majority of these were evolutionist one notable exception was the berliner gesellschaft anthropologie ethnologie und urgeschichte founded by rudolph virchow known for his vituperative attacks on the evolutionists not religious himself he insisted that darwins conclusions lacked empirical foundation

during the last three decades of the century a proliferation of anthropological societies and associations occurred most independent most publishing their own journals and all international in membership and association the major theorists belonged to these organizations they supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the major institutions of higher learning by educational institutions in countries had some curriculum in anthropology none of the faculty members were under a department named journal of instruction in anthropology in europe and the united states grant of the american association for the advancement of science


this meager statistic expanded in the century to comprise anthropology departments in the majority of the worlds higher educational institutions many thousands in number anthropology has diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more practical anthropology the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to solve specific problems has for example the presence of buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to recreate the final scene the organization has reached global level for example the world council of anthropological associations wcaa a network of national regional and international associations that aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in anthropology currently contains members from about three dozen nations

since the work of franz boas and malinowski in the late and early centuries social anthropology in great britain and cultural anthropology in the us have been distinguished from other social sciences by their emphasis on studies examination of context and the importance they place on participant observation or experiential immersion in the area of research cultural anthropology in particular has emphasized cultural relativism holism and the use of findings to frame cultural critiqueshylland eriksen thomas what is anthropology pluto london p this has been particularly prominent in the united states from boasian anthropology against racial ideology through margaret meads advocacy for gender equality and sexual liberation to current criticisms of oppression and promotion of multiculturalism ethnography is one of its primary research designs as well as the text that is generated from anthropological fieldworkon varieties of cultural relativism in anthropology see spiro melford e some reflections on cultural determinism and relativism with special reference to emotion and reason in culture and human nature theoretical papers of melford e spiro edited by b kilborne and ll langness chicago university of chicago press

in great britain and the commonwealth countries the british tradition of social anthropology tends to dominate in the united states anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach developed by franz boas in the early century biological social anthropology cultural anthropology or sociocultural and plus linguistic anthropology these fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and techniques

european countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more ethnology a term coined and defined by adam in it is sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the world that were influenced by the european traditionlayton robert an introduction to theory in anthropology cambridge cambridge university press




anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities social sciences and natural sciences anthropology builds upon knowledge from natural sciences including the discoveries about the origin and evolution of human human physical traits human behavior the variations among different groups of humans how the evolutionary past of homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture and from social sciences including the organization of human social and cultural relations institutions social conflicts etc what is anthropology american anthropological association aaanetorg retrieved on november what is anthropology living anthropologically retrieved on early anthropology originated in classical greece and persia and studied and tried to understand observable cultural diversity such as by of the islamic golden ageunderstanding other religions and gadamers fusion of horizons
by kemal ataman page as such anthropology has been central in the development of several new late century interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science global studies and various ethnic studies




sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralism and postmodern theories as well as a shift toward the analysis of modern societies during the and there was an epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had largely informed the disciplinegeertz behar clifford james during this shift enduring questions about the nature and production of knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social anthropology in contrast archaeology and biological anthropology remained largely positivist due to this difference in epistemology the four of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last several decades



sociocultural anthropology draws together the principle axes of cultural anthropology and social anthropology cultural anthropology is the comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the world around them while social anthropology is the study of the relationships among individuals and groups cultural anthropology is more related to philosophy literature and the arts how ones culture affects the experience for self and group contributing to a more complete understanding of the peoples knowledge customs and institutions while social anthropology is more related to sociology and history in that it helps develop an understanding of social structures typically of others and other populations such as minorities subgroups dissidents etc there is no distinction between them and these categories overlap to a considerable degree

inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural relativism the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their own cultural symbols and values accepting other cultures in their own terms moderates reductionism in comparison this project is often accommodated in the field of ethnography ethnography can refer to both a methodology and the product of ethnographic research ie an ethnographic monograph as a methodology ethnography is based upon fieldwork within a community or other research site participant observation is one of the foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures the process of can be especially helpful to understanding a culture from an emic conceptual vs etic or technical point of view

agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact natural economic and social sciences that are used in the practice and understanding of agriculture veterinary medicine but not animal science is often excluded from the definition

intensification of agriculture since the in developed and developing country often referred to as the green revolution was closely tied to progress made in selecting and improving crops and animals for high productivity as well as to developing additional inputs such as artificial fertilizers and pesticides

as the oldest and largest human intervention in nature the environmental impact of agriculture in general and more recently intensive agriculture industrial development and population growth have raised many questions among agricultural scientists and have led to the development and emergence of new fields these include technological fields that assume the solution to technological problems lies in better technology such as integrated pest management waste management technologies landscape architecture genomics and agricultural philosophy fields that include references to food industry as something essentially different from economic goods in fact the interaction between these two approaches provide a fertile field for deeper understanding in agricultural science

new technologies such as biotechnology and computer science for data processing and storage and technological advances have made it possible to develop new research fields including genetic engineering agrophysics improved statistics and precision farming balancing these as above are the natural and human sciences of agricultural science that seek to understand the interactions of history of agriculture including interaction of religion and agriculture and the components of agricultural production

alchemy from arabic from ancient greek definition of alchemy in english by oxford dictionaries september is an ancient branch of natural philosophy a philosophical and protoscience tradition practiced throughout europe africa china and throughout asia observable in chinese alchemy text from around bce and egypt roman province in the first few centuries ceprincipe lawrence m the secrets of alchemy university of chicago press pp

alchemists attempted to purify mature and perfect certain a detailed look into the problems of defining alchemy see common aims were chrysopoeia the transmutation of elements of base metals eg lead into noble metals particularly the creation of an elixir of the creation of panacea medicine able to cure any and the development of an alkahest a universal solvent the perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the magnum opus alchemy and in the hellenistic period and western mystery tradition the achievement of gnosis in europe the creation of a philosophers stone was variously connected with all of these projects

in english the term is often limited to descriptions of european alchemy but similar practices existed in the chinese alchemy the rasayana and the alchemy and chemistry in medieval islam in europe following the renaissance of the century produced by the latin translations of the century of science in the medieval islamic world and the recovery of aristotle list of alchemists played a significant role in early modern era daniel r knowledge in the early modern world r h daniel particularly history of chemistry and history of medicine islamic and european alchemists developed a structure of basic laboratory techniques theory terminology and experimental method some of which are still in use today however they continued classical antiquitys belief in four elements and guarded their work in secrecy including history of cryptography and cryptic symbolism their work was guided by hermeticism related to magic paranormal mythology and religionwouter j hanegraaff cambridge university press alchemy between science and religion esotericism and the academy rejected knowledge in western culture

modern discussions of alchemy are generally split into an examination of its exoteric practical applications and its esoteric spiritual aspects despite criticisms by scholars such as eric john holmyard and von franz that they should be understood as complementary the former is pursued by history of the physical sciences who examine the subject in terms of history of chemistry history of medicine and charlatanism and the philosophical and religious contexts in which these events occurred the latter interests historians of esotericism history of psychology and some philosophers and spirituality the subject has also made an ongoing impact on literature and the arts despite this split which von franz believes has existed since the western traditions origin in a mix of greek philosophy that was mixed with ancient egyptian technology and mesopotamian science numerous sources have stressed an integration of esoteric and exoteric approaches to alchemy as far back as on physical and mystical matters matteo martelli the four books of maney

although alchemy is popularly associated with magic historian lawrence m principe argues that recent historical research has revealed that medieval and early modern alchemy embraced a much more diverse set of ideas goals techniques and practices
most readers probably are aware of several common claims about example that it is akin to magic or that its practice then or now is essentially deceptive these ideas about alchemy emerged during the eighteenth century or after while each of them might have limited validity within a narrow context none of them is an accurate depiction of alchemy in generalprincipe lawrence m the secrets of alchemy university of chicago press



the word alchemy comes from old french alquemie alkimie used in medieval latin as this name was itself brought from the arabic word or composed of two parts the late greek term also spelled khumeia and see below and the arabic definite article meaning the together this association can be interpreted as the process of magnum opus alchemy by which to fuse or reunite with the divine or original form several etymologies have been proposed for the greek term the first was proposed by zosimos of panopolis centuries who derived it from the name of a book the khemeugeorge syncellus chronography the ancient definitions of alchemy in ancient greek and syriac texts see matteo martelli the alchemical art of dyeing the fourfold division of alchemy and the enochian tradition in s eds laboratories of art springer cham hermanm diels argued in that it rather derived from diels antike technik leipzig teubner p iarchivebub gb used to describe metallic objects formed by casting

others trace its roots to the egyptian language name hieroglyphic khmi meaning black earth which refers to the fertile and wiktauriferous soil of the nile valley as opposed to red desert sand according to the egyptologist wallis budge the arabic word actually means the egyptian science borrowing from the coptic language word for egypt or its equivalent in the mediaeval bohairic dialect of coptic this coptic word derives from demotic egyptian itself from ancient egyptian language kmt the ancient egyptian word referred to both the country and the colour black egypt was the black land by contrast with the red land the surrounding so this etymology could also explain the nickname egyptian black arts


alchemy encompasses several philosophical traditions spanning some four millennia and three continents these traditions general penchant for cryptic and symbolic language makes it hard to trace their mutual influences and genetic relationships one can distinguish at least three major strands which appear to be mostly independent at least in their earlier stages chinese alchemy centered in china and rasayana centered on the indian and western alchemy which occurred around the mediterranean basin and whose center has shifted over the millennia from egypt roman province to the muslim world and finally middle ages chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoism and indian alchemy with the indian religions in contrast western alchemy developed its philosophical system mostly independent of but influenced by various western religions it is still an open question whether these three strands share a common origin or to what extent they influenced each other





the start of western alchemy may generally be traced to ancient and hellenistic egypt where the city of alexandria was a center of alchemical knowledge and retained its through most of the greek and roman periodsnew scientist december following the work of modern scholars see alchemical practice in the roman empire as originating from the egyptian goldsmiths art greek philosophy and different religious traditions tracing the origins of the alchemical art in egypt is complicated by the pseudepigraphic nature of texts from the greek alchemical corpus the treatises of zosimos of panopolis the earliest historically attested author floruit c ce can however help in situating the other authors zosimus based his work on that of older alchemical authors such as mary the jewesssee and agathodaimon but very little is known about any of these authors the most complete of their works the four books of were probably written in the first century ad

recent scholarship tend to emphasizes the testimony of zosimus who traced the alchemical arts back to egyptian metallurgical and ceremonial practices it has also been argued that early alchemical writers borrowed the vocabulary of greek philosophical schools but did not implement any of its doctrines in a systematic way zosimos of panopolis wrote in the final abstinence also known as the final countthe title of the is traditionally translated as the final count considering that the treatise does not mention any count nor counting and that it makes a case against the use of sacrifice in the practice of alchemy a preferable translation would be the final abstinence see zosimos explains that the ancient practice of tinctures the technical greek name for the alchemical arts had been taken over by certain demons who taught the art only to those who offered them sacrifices since zosimos also called the demons gardians of places and those who offered them sacrifices priests it is fairly clear that he was referring to the gods of egypt and their priests while critical of the kind alchemy he associated with the egyptian priests and their followers zosimos nonetheless saw the traditions recent past as rooted in the rites of the egyptian temples

mythology zosimos of panopolis asserted that alchemy dated back to ancient egypt where it was the domain of the priestly class though there is little to no evidence for his assertion alchemical writers used classical figures from greek roman and egyptian mythology to illuminate their works and allegorize alchemical transmutationyves bonnefoy roman and european mythologies university of chicago press pp these included the pantheon of gods related to the classical planets isis osiris jason and many others

the central figure in the mythology of alchemy is hermes trismegistus or hermes his name is derived from the deity thoth and his greek counterpart hermesa survey of the literary and archaeological evidence for the background of hermes trismegistus in the greek hermes and the egyptian thoth may be found in bull christian h the tradition of hermes trismegistus the egyptian priestly figure as a teacher of hellenized wisdom leiden brill pp hermes and his caduceus or were among alchemys principal symbols according to clement of alexandria he wrote what were called the books of hermes covering all fields of of stromata or iv the hermetica of hermes is generally understood to form the basis for western alchemical philosophy and practice called the hermeticism by its early practitioners these writings were collected in the first centuries of the common era

technology the dawn of western alchemy is sometimes associated with that of metallurgy extending back to many writings were lost when the roman emperor diocletian ordered the burning of alchemical books after suppressing a revolt in alexandria few original egyptian documents on alchemy have survived most notable among them the stockholm papyrus and the leyden papyrus x dating from they contained recipes for dyeing and making artificial gemstones cleaning and fabricating pearls and manufacturing of imitation gold and silver these writings lack the mystical philosophical elements of alchemy but do contain the works of bolus of mendes or which aligned these recipes with theoretical knowledge of astrology and the classical elementsa history of chemistry isabelle stengers harvard university press between the time of bolus and zosimos the change took place that transformed this metallurgy into a hermetic art

philosophy alexandria acted as a melting pot for philosophies of pythagoreanism platonism stoicism and gnosticism which formed the origin of alchemys character an important example of alchemys roots in greek philosophy originated by empedocles and developed by aristotle was that all things in the universe were formed from only four elements earth classical element air classical element water classical element and fire classical element according to aristotle each element had a sphere to which it belonged and to which it would return if left undisturbed the four elements of the greek were mostly qualitative aspects of matter not quantitative as our modern elements true alchemy never regarded earth air water and fire as corporeal or chemical substances in the sense of the word the four elements are simply the primary and most general qualities by means of which the amorphous and purely quantitative substance of all bodies first reveals itself in differentiated form later alchemists extensively developed the mystical aspects of this concept

most of the alchemists preceding zosimos are known only by pseudonyms such as moses of alexandria isis cleopatra the alchemist and ostanes others authors such as komarios and chymes we only know through fragments of text after greek alchemical writers occupied themselves solely in commenting on the works of these predecessorsf sherwood taylor alchemists founders of modern chemistry by the middle of the century alchemy was almost an entirely mystical disciplineallen g debus alchemy and early modern chemistry papers from ambix p it was at that time that khalid ibn yazid sparked its migration from alexandria to the islamic world facilitating the translation and preservation of greek alchemical texts in the and centuriesglen warren bowersock peter robert lamont brown oleg grabar late antiquity a guide to the postclassical world p

after the fall of the roman empire the focus of alchemical development moved to the islamic world much more is known about islamic alchemy because it was better documented indeed most of the earlier writings that have come down through the years were preserved as arabic translations the word alchemy itself was derived from the arabic word the early islamic world was a melting pot for alchemy platonic and aristotle thought which had already been somewhat appropriated into hermetical science continued to be assimilated during the late and early centuries through syriac language translations and scholarship

in the late ninth and early tenth centuries the arabic works attributed to ibn latinized as geber or geberus introduced a new approach to alchemy paul kraus arabist who wrote the standard reference work on jabir put it as follows



the efforts of berthelot and ruelle to put a little order in this mass of literature led only to poor results and the later researchers among them in particular mrs tannery lagercrantz von lippmann reitzenstein ruska bidez and others could make clear only few points of detail

the study of the greek alchemists is not very encouraging an even surface examination of the greek texts shows that a very small part only was organized according to true experiments of laboratory even the supposedly technical writings in the state where we find them today are unintelligible nonsense which refuses any interpretation

it is different with jabirs alchemy the relatively clear description of the processes and the alchemical apparati the methodical classification of the substances mark an experimental spirit which is extremely far away from the weird and odd esotericism of the greek texts the theory on which jabir supports his operations is one of clearness and of an impressive unity more than with the other arab authors one notes with him a balance between theoretical teaching and practical teaching between the ilm arabic and the amal in vain one would seek in the greek texts a work as systematic as that which is presented for example in the book of seventykraus paul ibn contribution lhistoire des scientifiques dans lislam i le corpus des ii et la science grecque cairo repr by fuat sezgin natural sciences in islam frankfurt


islamic philosophers also made great contributions to alchemical hermeticism the most influential author in this regard was arguably jabir jabirs ultimate goal was takwin the artificial creation of life in the alchemical laboratory up to and including human life he analyzed each aristotelian element in terms of four basic qualities of hotness coldness dryness and moistness according to jabir in each metal two of these qualities were interior and two were exterior for example lead was externally cold and dry while gold was hot and moist thus jabir theorized by rearranging the qualities of one metal a different metal would result by this reasoning the search for the philosophers stone was introduced to western alchemy jabir developed an elaborate numerology whereby the root letters of a substances name in arabic when treated with various transformations held correspondences to the elements physical properties

the elemental system used in medieval alchemy also originated with jabir his original system consisted of seven elements which included the five classical elements aether element air classical element earth classical element fire classical element and water classical in addition to two chemical elements representing the metals sulfur the stone which burns which characterized the principle of combustibility and mercury element which contained the idealized principle of metallic properties shortly thereafter this evolved into eight elements with the arabic concept of the three metallic principles sulphur giving flammability or combustion mercury giving volatility and stability and salt chemistry giving soliditystrathern paul mendeleyevs dream the quest for the elements new york berkley books the atomic theory of corpuscularianism where all physical bodies possess an inner and outer layer of minute particles or corpuscles also has its origins in the work of jabir

from the to centuries alchemical theories faced criticism from a variety of practical muslim chemists including in oliver leaman hossein nasr history of islamic philosophy p london routledge avicennarobert briffault the making of humanity p and ibn khaldun in particular they wrote refutations against the idea of the philosophers stone




whereas european alchemy eventually centered on the transmutation of base metals into noble metals chinese alchemy had a more obvious connection to medicine the philosophers stone of european alchemists can be compared to the elixir of life sought by chinese alchemists however in the hermetic view these two goals were not unconnected and the philosophers stone was often equated with the panacea therefore the two traditions may have had more in common than initially appears

black powder may have been an important invention of chinese alchemists as previously stated above china alchemy was more related to medicine it is said that the chinese invented gunpowder while trying to find a potion for eternal life described in texts and used in fireworks in china by the century it was used in cannons by from china the use of gunpowder spread to japan the mongols the muslim world and europe gunpowder was used by the mongols against the hungarians in and in europe by the century

chinese alchemy was closely connected to taoist forms of traditional chinese medicine such as acupuncture and moxibustion in the early song dynasty followers of this taoist idea chiefly the elite and upper class would ingest cinnabar which though tolerable in low levels led many to suicide thinking that this consequential death would lead to freedom and access to the taoist heavens the ensuing deaths encouraged people to eschew this method of alchemy in favor of external sources the aforementioned tai chi chuan mastering of the qi etc






the introduction of alchemy to latin europe may be dated to february with the completion of robert of chesters translation of the arabic the book of the composition of alchemy although european craftsmen and technicians robert notes in his preface that alchemy though here still referring to the philosophers stone rather than to the art itselfhalleux robert reception of arabic alchemy in the in rashed roshdi ed encyclopedia of the history of arabic science vol london new york routledge vol iii pp p moureau ad alchimiam the transmission of alchemy from the world to the latin west in the middle in micrologus pp p was unknown in latin europe at the time of his writing the translation of arabic texts concerning numerous disciplines including alchemy flourished in toledo spain through contributors like gerard of cremona and adelard of bath translations of the time included the turba philosophorum and the works of avicenna and these brought with them many new words to the european vocabulary for which there was no previous latin equivalent alcohol carboy elixir and athanor are examples

meanwhile theologian contemporaries of the translators made strides towards the reconciliation of faith and experimental rationalism thereby priming europe for the influx of alchemical thought the anselm of canterbury put forth the opinion that faith and rationalism were compatible and encouraged rationalism in a christian context in the early century peter abelard followed anselms work laying down the foundation for acceptance of aristotelian thought before the first works of aristotle had reached the west in the early century robert grosseteste used abelards methods of analysis and added the use of observation experimentation and conclusions when conducting scientific investigations grosseteste also did much work to reconcile platonic and aristotelian thinking

through much of the and centuries alchemical knowledge in europe remained centered on translations and new latin contributions were not made the efforts of the translators were succeeded by that of the encyclopaedists in the century albertus magnus and roger bacon were the most notable of these their work summarizing and explaining the newly imported alchemical knowledge in aristotelian termsjohn read from alchemy to chemistry albertus magnus a dominican order is known to have written works such as the book of minerals where he observed and commented on the operations and theories of alchemical authorities like hermes and democritus and unnamed alchemists of his time albertus critically compared these to the writings of aristotle and avicenna where they concerned the transmutation of metals from the time shortly after his death through to the century more than alchemical tracts were misattributed to him a common practice giving rise to his reputation as an accomplished alchemistjames a weisheipl albertus magnus and the sciences commemorative essays pims likewise alchemical texts have been attributed to alberts student thomas aquinas

roger bacon a franciscan order who wrote on a wide variety of topics including optics comparative linguistics and medicine composed his opus majus for as part of a project towards rebuilding the medieval university curriculum to include the new learning of his time while alchemy was not more important to him than other sciences and he did not produce allegorical works on the topic he did consider it and astrology to be important parts of both natural philosophy and theology and his contributions advanced alchemys connections to soteriology and christian theology bacons writings integrated morality salvation alchemy and the prolongation of life his correspondence with clement highlighted this noting the importance of alchemy to the papacyedmund brehm roger bacons place in the history of alchemy ambix vol part i march like the greeks before him bacon acknowledged the division of alchemy into practical and theoretical spheres he noted that the theoretical lay outside the scope of aristotle the natural philosophers and all latin writers of his time the practical however confirmed the theoretical thought experiment and bacon advocated its uses in natural science and medicine in later european legend however bacon became an archmage in particular along with albertus magnus he was credited with the forging of a brazen head capable of answering its owners questions

soon after bacon the influential work of sometimes identified as paul of taranto appeared his summa perfectionis remained a staple summary of alchemical practice and theory through the medieval and renaissance periods it was notable for its inclusion of practical chemical operations alongside theory and the unusual clarity with which they were described by the end of the century alchemy had developed into a fairly structured system of belief adepts believed in the theories of hermes that is to say they believed that processes that affect minerals and other substances could have an effect on the human body for example if one could learn the secret of purifying gold one could use the technique to purify the soul they believed in the four elements and the four qualities as described above and they had a strong tradition of cloaking their written ideas in a labyrinth of coded jargon set with traps to mislead the uninitiated finally the alchemists practiced their art they actively experimented with chemicals and made observations and theory about how the universe operated their entire philosophy revolved around their belief that mans soul was divided within himself after the fall of adam by purifying the two parts of mans soul man could be reunited with god

in the late century marsilo ficino translated the corpus hermeticum and the works of plato into latin these were previously unavailable to europeans who for the first time had a full picture of the alchemical theory that bacon had declared absent renaissance humanism and renaissance neoplatonism guided alchemists away from physics to refocus on mankind as the alchemical vessel

entrepreneurial opportunities were common for the alchemists of renaissance europe alchemists were contracted by the elite for practical purposes related to mining medical services and the production of chemicals medicines metals and gemstonestara e nummedal alchemy and authority in the holy roman empire rudolf ii holy roman emperor in the late century famously received and sponsored various alchemists at his court in prague including dee and his associate edward kelley james iv of scotlandaccounts of the lord high treasurer of scotland vol iii julius duke of henry v duke of augustus elector of saxony julius echter von mespelbrunn and maurice landgrave of all contracted alchemiststara e nummedal alchemy and authority in the holy roman empire johns son arthur dee worked as a court physician to michael i of russia and charles i of england but also compiled the alchemical book fasciculus chemicus

the terms chemia and alchemia were used as synonyms in the early modern period and the differences between alchemy chemistry and assaying and metallurgy were not as neat as in the present day there were important overlaps between practitioners and trying to classify them into alchemists chemists and craftsmen is anachronistic for example tycho brahe an alchemist better known for his astronomical and astrological investigations had a laboratory built at his uraniborg institute a poland alchemist philosopher medical doctor and pioneer of chemistry wrote mystical works but is also credited with distilling oxygen in a lab sometime around sendivogious taught his technique to cornelius drebbel who in applied this in a submarine isaac newton devoted considerably more of his writing to the study of alchemy see isaac newtons occult studies than he did to either optics or physics other early modern alchemists who were eminent in their other studies include robert boyle and jan baptist van helmont their hermeticism complemented rather than precluded their practical achievements in medicine and science




the decline of european alchemy was brought about by the rise of modern science with its emphasis on rigorous quantitative experimentation and its disdain for ancient wisdom although the seeds of these events were planted as early as the century alchemy still flourished for some two hundred years and in fact may have reached its peak in the century as late as james price chemist claimed to have produced a powder that could transmute mercury into silver or gold early modern european alchemy continued to exhibit a diversity of theories practices and purposes scholastic and paracelsian and hermetic neoplatonic mechanistic vitalistic and virtually every combination and compromise thereof

robert boyle pioneered the scientific method in chemical investigations he assumed nothing in his experiments and compiled every piece of relevant data boyle would note the place in which the experiment was carried out the wind characteristics the position of the sun and moon and the barometer reading all just in case they proved to be relevant this approach eventually led to the founding of modern chemistry in the and centuries based on revolutionary discoveries of antoine lavoisier and john dalton

beginning around a rigid distinction began to be drawn for the first time between alchemy and chemistry by the alchemy was now restricted to the realm of gold making leading to the popular belief that alchemists were charlatans and the tradition itself nothing more than a fraud in order to protect the developing science of modern chemistry from the negative censure to which alchemy was being subjected academic writers during the scientific enlightenment attempted for the sake of survival to divorce and separate the new chemistry from the old practices of alchemy this move was mostly successful and the consequences of this continued into the and centuries

during the occult revival of the early century alchemy received new attention as an occult science the esoteric or occultist school which arose during the century held and continues to hold the view that the substances and operations mentioned in alchemical literature are to be interpreted in a spiritual sense and it downplays the role of the alchemy as a practical tradition or protoscience this interpretation further forwarded the view that alchemy is an art primarily concerned with spiritual enlightenment or illumination as opposed to the physical manipulation of apparatus and chemicals and claims that the obscure language of the alchemical texts were an allegorical guise for spiritual moral or mystical processes

in the revival of alchemy the two most seminal figures were mary anne atwood and ethan a hitchcock general who independently published similar works regarding spiritual alchemy both forwarded a completely esoteric view of alchemy as atwood claimed no modern art or chemistry notwithstanding all its surreptitious claims has any thing in common with alchemy atwoods work influenced subsequent authors of the occult revival including eliphas levi arthur edward waite and rudolf steiner hitchcock in his remarks upon alchymists attempted to make a case for his spiritual interpretation with his claim that the alchemists wrote about a spiritual discipline under a materialistic guise in order to avoid accusations of blasphemy from the church and state in baron carl reichenbach published his studies on odic force a concept with some similarities to alchemy but his research did not enter the mainstream of scientific discussiondaniel merkur gnosis an esoteric tradition of mystical visions and unions suny press

the first alchemist whose name we know is said to have been mary the jewess c ad early sources claim that mary or maria devised a number of improvements to alchemical equipment and tools as well as novel techniques in chemistry her best known advances were in heating and distillation processes the laboratory known eponymously especially in france as the is said to have been invented or at least improved by her essentially a it was and is used in chemistry for processes that require gentle heating the tribikos a modified distillation apparatus and the kerotakis a more intricate apparatus used especially for sublimations are two other advancements in the process of distillation that are credited to her although we have no writing from mary herself she is known from the writings of zosimos of panopolis

due to the proliferation of pseudepigrapha and anonymous works it is difficult to know which of the alchemists were actually women after the period womens names appear less frequently in the alchemical literature women vacate the history of alchemy during the medieval and renaissance periods aside from the fictitious account of perenelle flamel mary anne atwoods a suggestive inquiry into the hermetic mystery marks their return during the occult revival

journals which publish regularly on the topic of alchemy include ambix published by the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry and isis journal published by the history of science society



western alchemical theory corresponds to the worldview of late antiquity in which it was born concepts were imported from neoplatonism and earlier greek cosmology as such the classical elements appear in alchemical writings as do the seven classical planets and the corresponding seven metals of antiquity similarly the gods of the roman pantheon who are associated with these luminaries are discussed in alchemical literature the concepts of prima materia and anima mundi are central to the theory of the philosophers stone



the great work of alchemy is often described as a series of four stages represented by colors







due to the complexity and obscurity of alchemical literature and the disappearance of remaining alchemical practitioners into the area of the general understanding of alchemy has been strongly influenced by several distinct and radically different interpretations those focusing on the exoteric such as historians of science lawrence m principe and william r newman have interpreted the decknamen or code words of alchemy as physical substances these scholars have reconstructed physicochemical experiments that they say are described in medieval and early modern textsrichard conniff alchemy may not have been the pseudoscience we all thought it was smithsonian magazine february at the opposite end of the spectrum focusing on the esoteric scholars such as george calian


today new interpretations of alchemy are still perpetuated sometimes merging in concepts from new age or radical environmentalism movements groups like the rosicrucianism and freemasonry have a continued interest in alchemy and its symbolism since the victorian revival of alchemy occultists reinterpreted alchemy as a spiritual practice involving the of the practitioner and only incidentally or not at all the transformation of laboratory substances which has contributed to a merger of magic paranormal and alchemy in popular thought

according to this view early alchemists such as zosimos of panopolis c ad highlighted the spiritual nature of the alchemical quest symbolic of a religious regeneration of the human soulallen g debus alchemy and early modern chemistry the society for the history of alchemy and chemistry this approach is held to have continued in the middle ages as metaphysical aspects substances physical states and material processes are supposed to have been used as metaphors for spiritual entities spiritual states and ultimately transformation in this sense the literal meanings of alchemical formulas were like a veil hiding their true spiritual philosophy in the interpretation both the transmutation of common metals into gold and the universal panacea are held to symbolize evolution from an imperfect diseased corruptible and ephemeral state toward a perfect healthy incorruptible and everlasting state so the philosophers stone then represented a mystic key that would make this evolution possible applied to the alchemist himself the twin goal symbolized his evolution from ignorance to enlightenment and the stone represented a hidden spiritual truth or power that would lead to that goal in texts that are held to have been written according to this view the cryptic alchemical symbols diagrams and textual imagery of late alchemical works are supposed to contain multiple layers of meanings allegories and references to other equally cryptic which must be laboriously decoded to discover their true meaning

astronomers usually fall under either of two main types observational astronomy and theoretical astronomy observational astronomers make direct observations of astronomical object and analyze the data in contrast theoretical astronomers create and investigate conceptual models of things that cannot be observed because it takes millions to billions of years for a system of stars or a galaxy to complete a life cycle astronomers must observe snapshots of different systems at unique points in their evolution to determine how they form evolve and die they use these data to create models or simulations to theorize how different celestial objects work

further subcategories under these two main branches of science of astronomy include planetary science galactic astronomy or physical cosmology



sustermans portrait of galileo galilei is often referred to as the father of modern astronomy portrait by justus sustermans

history of astronomy astronomy was more concerned with the classification and description of phenomena in the sky while astrophysics attempted to explain these phenomena and the differences between them using scientific law today that distinction has mostly disappeared and the terms astronomer and astrophysicist are interchangeable professional astronomers are highly educated individuals who typically have a doctor of philosophy in physics or astronomy and are employed by research institutions or universities they spend the majority of their time working on research although they quite often have other duties such as teaching building instruments or aiding in the operation of an observatory

the american astronomical society which is the major organization of professional astronomers in north america has approximately members this number includes scientists from other fields such as physics geology and engineering whose research interests are closely related to astronomy the international astronomical union comprises almost members from different countries who are involved in astronomical research at the phd level and beyond

contrary to the classical image of an old astronomer peering through a telescope through the dark hours of the night it is far more common to use a device ccd camera to record a long deep exposure allowing a more sensitive image to be created because the light is added over time before ccds photographic plates were a common method of observation modern astronomers spend relatively little time at telescopes usually just a few weeks per year analysis of observed phenomena along with making predictions as to the causes of what they observe takes the majority of observational astronomers time

astronomers who serve as faculty spend much of their time teaching undergraduate and graduate classes most universities also have outreach programs including public telescope time and sometimes planetariums as a public service to encourage interest in the field

those who become astronomers usually have a broad background in maths sciences and computing in high school taking courses that teach how to research write and present papers are also invaluable in most astronomers get a phd in astronomy or physics



while there is a relatively low number of professional astronomers the field is popular among amateurs most cities have amateur astronomy clubs that meet on a regular basis and often host star party the astronomical society of the pacific is the largest general astronomical society in the world comprising both professional and amateur astronomers as well as educators from different nations like any hobby most people who think of themselves as amateur astronomers may devote a few hours a month to stargazing and reading the latest developments in research however amateurs span the range from armchair astronomers to the very ambitious who own telescopes and instruments with which they are able to make their own discoveries and assist professional astronomers in research











































































































ascii abbreviated from american standard code for information interchange is a character encoding standard for electronic communication ascii codes represent text in computers telecommunications equipment and other devices most modern schemes are based on ascii although they support many additional characters

the internet assigned numbers authority iana prefers the name for this character encoding




ascii was developed from telegraph code its first commercial use was as a teleprinter code promoted by bell data services work on the ascii standard began on october with the first meeting of the american standards associations asa now the american national standards institute or ansi subcommittee the first edition of the standard was published in underwent a major revision during and experienced its most recent update during compared to earlier telegraph codes the proposed bell code and ascii were both ordered for more convenient sorting ie alphabetization of lists and added features for devices other than teleprinters

the use of ascii format for network interchange was described in that document was formally elevated to an internet standard in

originally based on the english alphabet ascii encodes specified character computing into integers as shown by the ascii chart above of the encoded characters are printable these include the digits to lowercase letters a to z uppercase letters a to z and punctuation symbols in addition the original ascii specification included control codes which originated with teletype most of these are now obsolete although a few are still commonly used such as the carriage return line feed and tab characters codes

for example lowercase i would be represented in the ascii encoding by binary number hexadecimal i is the ninth letter decimal



the american standard code for information interchange ascii was developed under the auspices of a committee of the american standards association asa called the committee by its later subcommittee and later by that subcommittees working group now incits the asa became the united states of america standards institute usasi and ultimately the american national standards institute ansi

with the other special characters and control codes filled in ascii was published as asa leaving code positions without any assigned meaning reserved for future standardization and one unassigned control code there was some debate at the time whether there should be more control characters rather than the lowercase alphabet the indecision did not last long during may the ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet proposed to assign lowercase characters to characters of the ascii character set are divided into eight groups called sticks associated with the three bits depending on the horizontal or vertical representation of the character map sticks correspond with either table rows or and report meeting of ccitt working party on the new telegraph alphabet may and international organization for standardization tc sc voted during october to incorporate the change into its draft standardreport of meeting of october the task group voted its approval for the change to ascii at its may meetingreport on task group june pentagon building washington dc locating the lowercase letters in sticks and caused the characters to differ in bit pattern from the upper case by a single bit which simplified character matching and the construction of keyboards and printers

the committee made other changes including other new characters the brace and vertical bar of meeting no task group december and renaming some control characters som became start of header and moving or removing others ru was removed ascii was subsequently updated as usas then usas ansi and finally ansi web character sets revisions of ascii oy
















in the standard the committee also addressed how ascii should be transmitted least significant bit first and how it should be recorded on perforated tape they proposed a standard for magnetic tape and attempted to deal with some punched card formats





the subcommittee designed ascii based on the earlier teleprinter encoding systems like other character encodings ascii specifies a correspondence between digital bit patterns and character computing symbols ie graphemes and control characters this allows digital data devices to communicate with each other and to process store and communicate information such as written language before ascii was developed the encodings in use included english alphabet characters numerical digits and from to special graphic symbols to include all these and control characters compatible with the ccitt ccitt international telegraph alphabet no standard of fieldata and early ebcdic more than codes were required for ascii

were in turn based on the telegraph code baudot invented in and patented in

the committee debated the possibility of a shift code function like in which would allow more than codes to be represented by a character code in a shifted code some character codes determine choices between options for the following character codes it allows compact encoding but is less reliable for data transmission as an error in transmitting the shift code typically makes a long part of the transmission unreadable the standards committee decided against shifting and so ascii required at least a code

the committee considered an code since eight bits octet would allow two patterns to efficiently encode two digits with decimal however it would require all data transmission to send eight bits when seven could suffice the committee voted to use a code to minimize costs associated with data transmission since perforated tape at the time could record eight bits in one position it also allowed for a parity bit for error checking if desired machines with octets as the native data type that did not use parity checking typically set the eighth bit to


the code itself was patterned so that most control codes were together and all graphic codes were together for ease of identification the first two ascii sticks positions were reserved for control characters the space punctuation had to come before graphics to make sorting algorithm easier so it became position for the same reason many special signs commonly used as separators were placed before digits the committee decided it was important to support upper case sixbit code pages and chose to pattern ascii so it could be reduced easily to a usable set of graphic codes as was done in the dec sixbit code lower case letters were therefore not interleaved with uppercase to keep options available for lowercase letters and other graphics the special and numeric codes were arranged before the letters and the letter a was placed in position to match the draft of the corresponding british standard the digits are prefixed with but the remaining nibble correspond to their respective values in binary making conversion with decimal straightforward

many of the characters were positioned to correspond to their shifted position on an important subtlety is that these were based on mechanical typewriters not electric typewriters mechanical typewriters followed the standard set by the remington no the first typewriter with a shift key and the shifted values of were early typewriters omitted and using o capital letter o and l lowercase letter l instead but and pairs became standard once and became common thus in ascii were placed in the second stick positions corresponding to the digits in the adjacent stick the parentheses could not correspond to and however because the place corresponding to was taken by the space character this was accommodated by removing underscore from and shifting the remaining characters which corresponded to many european typewriters that placed the parentheses with and this discrepancy from typewriters led to keyboards notably the teletype model which used the layout corresponding to ascii not to traditional mechanical typewriters electric typewriters notably the ibm selectric used a somewhat different layout that has become standard on computers following the ibm pc especially model m and thus shift values for symbols on modern keyboards do not correspond as closely to the ascii table as earlier keyboards did the pair also dates to the no and the pairs were used on some keyboards others including the no did not shift or full stop so they could be used in uppercase without however ascii split the pair dating to no and rearranged mathematical symbols varied conventions commonly to

some common characters were not included notably while were included as diacritics for international use and for mathematical use together with the simple line characters in addition to common the symbol was not used in continental europe and the committee expected it would be replaced by an accented in the french variation so the was placed in position right before the letter a

the control codes felt essential for data transmission were the start of message som end of address eoa end of message eom end of transmission eot who are wru are ru a reserved device control synchronous idle sync and acknowledge ack these were positioned to maximize the hamming distance between their bit patterns


order is also called asciibetical order collation of data is sometimes done in this order rather than standard alphabetical order collating sequence the main deviations in ascii order are



an intermediate order converts uppercase letters to lowercase before comparing ascii values






ascii reserves the first codes numbers decimal for control characters codes originally intended not to represent printable information but rather to control devices such as computer printer that make use of ascii or to provide metadata about data streams such as those stored on magnetic tape

for example character represents the line feed function which causes a printer to advance its paper and character represents backspace refers to control characters that do not include carriage return line feed or whitespace computer science as control characters nb except for the control characters that prescribe elementary formatting ascii does not define any mechanism for describing the structure or appearance of text within a document other schemes such as markup languages address page and document layout and formatting

the original ascii standard used only short descriptive phrases for each control character the ambiguity this caused was sometimes intentional for example where a character would be used slightly differently on a terminal link than on a data stream and sometimes accidental for example with the meaning of delete

probably the most influential single device on the interpretation of these characters was the teletype model asr which was a printing terminal with an available punched tape option paper tape was a very popular medium for program storage until the less costly and in some ways less fragile than magnetic tape in particular the teletype model machine assignments for codes also known as xon also known as xoff and delete key became de facto standards the model was also notable for taking the description of code bel meaning audibly alert the operator literally as the unit contained an actual bell which it rang when it received a bel character because the keytop for the o key also showed a symbol from which had this character instead of underscore a noncompliant use of code shift in interpreted as delete previous character was also adopted by many early timesharing systems but eventually became neglected

when a teletype asr equipped with the automatic paper tape reader received a xoff an abbreviation for transmit off it caused the tape reader to receiving xon transmit on caused the tape reader to resume this technique became adopted by several early computer operating systems as a handshaking signal warning a sender to stop transmission because of impending it persists to this day in many systems as a manual output control technique on some systems retains its meaning but is replaced by a second to resume output the asr also could be configured to employ and to start and stop the tape on some units equipped with this function the corresponding control character lettering on the keycap above the letter was tape and tape respectively



the teletype could not move the head backwards so it did not put a key on the keyboard to send a bs backspace instead there was a key marked that sent code del the purpose of this key was to erase mistakes in a paper tape the operator had to push a button on the tape punch to back it up then type the rubout which punched all holes and replaced the mistake with a character that was intended to be ignored teletypes were commonly used for the computers from digital equipment corporation so these systems had to use the available key and thus the del code to erase the previous character because of this dec video terminals by default sent the del code for the key marked backspace while the key marked delete sent an escape sequence while many other terminals sent bs for the backspace key the unix terminal driver could only use one code to erase the previous character this could be set to bs or del but not both resulting in a long period of annoyance where users had to correct it depending on what terminal they were using shells that allow line editing such as kornshell bash shell and z shell understand the assumption that no key sent a bs caused to be used for other purposes such as the help prefix command in gnu emacs


many more of the control codes have been given meanings quite different from their original ones the escape character esc code for example was intended originally to allow sending other control characters as literals instead of invoking their meaning this is the same meaning of escape encountered in url encodings c programming language strings and other systems where certain characters have a reserved meaning over time this meaning has been and has eventually been changed in modern use an esc sent to the terminal usually indicates the start of a command sequence usually in the form of a ansi escape code or more properly a control sequence introducer from and its successors beginning with esc followed by a character an esc sent from the terminal is most often used as an data character used to terminate an operation as in the text editor and corrector and vi text editors in graphical user interface gui and window computing systems esc generally causes an application to abort its current operation or to exit system call terminate altogether



the inherent ambiguity of many control characters combined with their historical usage created problems when transferring plain text files between systems the best example of this is the newline problem on various operating systems teletype machines required that a line of text be terminated with both carriage return which moves the printhead to the beginning of the line and line feed which advances the paper one line without moving the printhead the name carriage return comes from the fact that on a manual typewriter the carriage holding the paper moved while the position where the typebars struck the ribbon remained stationary the entire carriage had to be pushed returned to the right in order to position the left margin of the paper for the next line

digital equipment corporation operating systems etc used both characters to mark the end of a line so that the console device originally teleprinter would work by the time glass ttys later called crts or terminals came along the convention was so well established that backward compatibility necessitated continuing the convention when gary kildall created he was inspired by some command line interface conventions used in digital equipment corporations until the introduction of pc dos in ibm had no hand in this because their operating systems used ebcdic instead of ascii and they were oriented toward input and line printer output on which the concept of carriage return was meaningless ibms pc dos also marketed as by microsoft inherited the convention by virtue of being loosely based on and windows inherited it from

unfortunately requiring two characters to mark the end of a line introduces unnecessary complexity and questions as to how to interpret each character when encountered alone to simplify matters plain text data streams including files on multics used line feed lf alone as a line terminator unix and systems and amiga systems adopted this convention from multics the original macintosh os apple dos and prodos on the other hand used carriage return cr alone as a line however since apple replaced these operating systems with the macos operating system they now use line feed lf as well the radio shack also used a lone cr to terminate lines

computers attached to the arpanet included machines running operating systems such as and tenex operating system using line endings machines running operating systems such as multics using lf line endings and machines running operating systems such as that represented lines as a character count followed by the characters of the line and that used ebcdic rather than ascii the telnet protocol defined an ascii network virtual terminal nvt so that connections between hosts with different conventions and character sets could be supported by transmitting a standard text format over the network telnet used ascii along with line endings and software using other conventions would translate between the local conventions and the nvt the file transfer protocol adopted the telnet protocol including use of the network virtual terminal for use when transmitting commands and transferring data in the default ascii mode this adds complexity to implementations of those protocols and to other network protocols such as those used for and the world wide web on systems not using the nvts convention



the monitor and its successor used sub as an indication for input from a terminal some operating systems such as tracked file length only in units of disk blocks and used to mark the end of the actual text in the file for these reasons eof or was used colloquially and conventionally as a acronym for instead of substitute the code character also known as was inappropriate for a variety of reasons while using z as the control code to end a file is analogous to it ending the alphabet and serves as a very convenient mnemonic device a historically common and still prevalent convention uses the etx code convention to interrupt and halt a program via an input data stream usually from a keyboard

in c library and unix conventions the null character is used to terminate text string computer such strings can be known in abbreviation as asciz or asciiz where here z stands for zero

ascii was first used commercially during as a teleprinter code for american telephone telegraphs twx teletypewriter exchange network twx originally used the earlier which was also used by the competing telex teleprinter system robert william bemer introduced features such as the escape character his british colleague hugh mcgregor ross helped to popularize this work according to bemer so much so that the code that was to become ascii was first called the code in europe nb bemer was employed at ibm at that time because of his extensive work on ascii bemer has been called the father of ascii

on march us president lyndon b johnson mandated that all computers purchased by the united states federal government support ascii stating
i have also approved recommendations of the secretary of commerce h regarding standards for recording the standard code for information interchange on magnetic tapes and paper tapes when they are used in computer operations
all computers and related equipment configurations brought into the federal government inventory on and after july must have the capability to use the standard code for information interchange and the formats prescribed by the magnetic tape and paper tape standards when these media are used

ascii was the most common character encoding on the world wide web until december when encoding surpassed is backward compatible with ascii


as computer technology spread throughout the world different standardization and corporations developed many variations of ascii to facilitate the expression of languages that used alphabets one could class some of these variations as ascii extensions although some misuse that term to represent all variants including those that do not preserve asciis in the range furthermore the ascii extensions have also been mislabelled as ascii



from early in its developmentspecific criteria attachment to memo from r w reach meeting september and september ascii was intended to be just one of several national variants of an international character code standard




other international standards bodies have ratified character encodings such as iso that are identical or nearly identical to ascii with extensions for characters outside the english alphabet and symbols used outside the united states such as the symbol for the united kingdoms pound sterling almost every country needed an adapted version of ascii since ascii suited the needs of only the us and a few other countries for example canada had its own version that supported french characters

many other countries developed variants of ascii to include letters eg currency symbols eg etc see also yuscii yugoslavia

it would share most characters in common but assign other locally useful characters to several code points reserved for national use however the four years that elapsed between the publication of and isos first acceptance of an international recommendation during caused asciis choices for the national use characters to seem to be de facto standards for the world causing confusion and incompatibility once other countries did begin to make their own assignments to these code points

like ascii is a character set it does not make any additional codes available so the same code points encoded different characters in different countries escape codes were defined to indicate which national variant applied to a piece of text but they were rarely used so it was often impossible to know what variant to work with and therefore which character a code represented and in general systems could cope with only one variant anyway

because the bracket and brace characters of ascii were assigned to national use code points that were used for accented letters in other national variants of a german french or swedish etc programmer using their national variant of rather than ascii had to write and thus read something such as







c trigraphs were created to solve this problem for ansi c although their late introduction and inconsistent implementation in compilers limited their use many programmers kept their computers on so in swedish german etc for example in or usenet contained and similar variants in the middle of words something those programmers got used to for example a swedish programmer mailing another programmer asking if they should go for lunch could get jag har as the answer which should be jag har meaning no ive got sandwiches




eventually as and and later computers began to replace and computers as the norm it became common to use an byte to store each character in memory providing an opportunity for extended relatives of ascii in most cases these developed as true extensions of ascii leaving the original intact but adding additional character definitions after the first ie characters

encodings include iscii india viscii vietnam although these encodings are sometimes referred to as ascii true ascii is defined strictly only by the ansi standard

most early home computer systems developed their own character sets containing and game glyphs and often filled in some or all of the control characters from to with more graphics kaypro computers used the upper characters for the greek alphabet

the petscii code commodore international used for their systems is probably unique among codes in being based on instead of the more common such as found on the zx spectrum character set computer atascii computers and galaksija rom computers also used ascii variants

the ibm pc defined code page which replaced the control characters with graphic symbols such as emoticon and mapped additional graphic characters to the upper positions operating systems such as dos supported these code pages and manufacturers of ibm pcs supported them in hardware digital equipment corporation developed the multinational character set for use in the popular computer terminal as one of the first extensions designed more for international languages than for block graphics the macintosh defined mac os roman and postscript also defined a set both of these contained both international letters and typographic punctuation marks instead of graphics more like modern character sets

the standard derived from the finally provided a standard that most systems copied at least as accurately as they copied ascii but with many substitutions a popular further extension designed by microsoft often mislabeled as added the typographic punctuation marks needed for traditional text printing and the original ascii were the most common character encodings until when became more common

introduced additional control codes defined in the hexadecimal range as part of extending the ascii encoding to become an system



unicode and the universal character set ucs have a much wider array of characters and their various encoding forms have begun to supplant and ascii rapidly in many environments while ascii is limited to characters unicode and the ucs support more characters by separating the concepts of unique identification using natural numbers called code points and encoding to or binary formats called and

ascii was incorporated into the unicode character set as the first symbols so the ascii characters have the same numeric codes in both sets this allows to be backward compatibility with ascii as a file containing only ascii characters is identical to an ascii file containing the same sequence of characters even more importantly forward compatibility is ensured as software that recognizes only ascii characters as special and does not alter bytes with the highest bit set as is often done to support ascii extensions such as will preserve data unchanged

animation is a method in which image are manipulated to appear as moving images in traditional animation images are drawn or painted by hand on transparent cel to be photographed and exhibited on film today most animations are made with imagery cgi computer animation can be very detailed computer methods while traditional and traditional animation which may have the look of traditional animation can be used for stylistic reasons low bandwidth or faster renderings other common animation methods apply a stop motion technique to two and objects like cutout animation puppets or clay animation

commonly the effect of animation is achieved by a rapid succession of sequential images that minimally differ from each other the in motion pictures in thought to rely on the phi phenomenon and beta movement but the exact causes are still uncertain
analog device mechanical animation media that rely on the rapid display of sequential images include the phenakistiscope zoetrope flip book praxinoscope and film television and video are popular electronic animation media that originally were analog and now operate digital media for display on the computer techniques like animated gif and flash animation were developed

animation is more pervasive than many people know apart from short films feature films television show animated gifs and other media dedicated to the display of moving images animation is also prevalent in video games motion graphics user interfaces and visual effects

the physical movement of image parts through simple instance moving images in magic lantern also be considered animation the mechanical manipulation of puppets and objects to emulate living beings has a very long history in automaton electronic automata were popularized by disney as animatronics





the word animation stems from the latin stem of meaning a bestowing of life the primary meaning of the english word is liveliness and has been in use much longer than the meaning of moving image medium






hundreds of years before the introduction of true animation people from all over the world enjoyed shows with moving figures that were created and manipulated manually in puppetry automaton shadow play and the magic lantern the phantasmagoria shows that were very popular in theatres from the late century through the first half of the century featured lifelike projections of moving ghosts and other frightful imagery in motion


in the stroboscope disc better known as the phenakistiscope introduced the principle of modern animation with sequential images that were shown one by one in quick succession to form an optical illusion of motion pictures series of sequential images had occasionally been made over thousands of years but the stroboscopic disc provided the first method to represent such images in fluent motion and for the first time had artists creating series with a proper systematic breakdown of movements the stroboscopic animation principle was also applied in the zoetrope the flip book and the praxinoscope the average animation contained about images that were displayed as a continuous loop by spinning a device manually the flip book often contained more pictures and had a beginning and end but its animation would not last longer than a few seconds the first to create much longer sequences seems to have been reynaud who between and had much success with his to optique


when cinematography eventually broke through in after animated pictures had been known for decades the wonder of the realistic details in the new medium was seen as its biggest accomplishment animation on film was not commercialized until a few years later by manufacturers of optical toys with chromolithography film loops often traced from footage for adapted toy magic lanterns intended for kids to use at home it would take some more years before animation reached movie theatres

after earlier experiments by movie pioneers j stuart blackton arthur segundo de and edwin s porter among others blacktons the haunted hotel was the first huge stop motion success baffling audiences by showing objects that apparently moved by themselves in full photographic detail without signs of any known stage trick


cohls fantasmagorie film is the oldest known example of what became known as traditional animation other great artistic and very influential short films were created by ladislas starevich with his puppet animations since and by winsor mccay with detailed drawn animation in films such as little nemo film and gertie the dinosaur

during the the production of animated cartoons became an industry in the us successful producer john randolph bray and animator earl hurd patented the cel animation process that dominated the animation industry for the rest of the century felix the cat who debuted in became the first animated superstar


in steamboat willie featuring mickey mouse and minnie mouse popularized film with synchronized sound and put walt disneys studio at the forefront of the animation industry in disney also introduced the innovation of full colour in flowers and trees as part of a exclusive deal with technicolor

the enormous success of mickey mouse is seen as the start of the golden age of american animation that would last until the the united states dominated the world market of animation with a plethora of theatrical shorts several studios would introduce characters that would become very popular and would have careers including walt disney productions goofy and donald duck warner bros cartoons looney tunes characters like daffy duck bugs bunny tweety sylvester the cat wile e coyote and road runner fleischer cartoon studios betty boop animated cartoons superman cartoons and casper the friendly ghost cartoon studios tom and jerry and droopy walter lantz studio cartoons woody woodpecker century foxs mighty mouse and united artists pink panther character



in director quirino cristiani made the first film el now lost film which became a critical and commercial success it was followed by cristianis sin dejar rastros in but one day after its premiere the film was confiscated by the government

after working on it for three years lotte reiniger released the german silhouette animation die abenteuer des prinzen achmed in the oldest extant animated feature

in walt disney animation studios premiered their first animated feature snow white and the seven dwarfs film still one of the traditional animation features total prior to anniversary reissue and grosses from north america the fleischer studios followed this example in with gullivers travels film with some success partly due to foreign markets being cut off by the second world war disneys next features pinocchio film fantasia film both and fleischer studios second animated feature mr bug goes to town failed at the box office for decades afterwards disney would be the only american studio to regularly produce animated features until ralph bakshi became the first to also release more than a handful features studios began to regularly produce animated features starting with an american tail in

although relatively few titles became as successful as disneys features other countries developed their own animation industries that produced both short and feature theatrical animations in a wide variety of styles relatively often including stop motion and cutout animation techniques russias soyuzmultfilm animation studio founded in produced films including shorts per year on average and reached titles in china czechoslovakia czech republic italy france and belgium were other countries that more than occasionally released feature films while japan became a true powerhouse of animation production with its own recognizable and influential anime style of effective limited animation


animation became very popular on television since the when television sets started to become common in most developed countries cartoons were mainly programmed for children on convenient time slots and especially us youth spent many hours watching cartoons many classic cartoons found a new life on the small screen and by the end of the production of new animated cartoons started to shift from theatrical releases to tv series productions was especially prolific and had huge hit series such as the flintstones the first prime time animated series since and belgian the smurfs tv series the constraints of american television programming and the demand for an enormous quantity resulted in cheaper and quicker limited animation methods and much more formulaic scripts quality dwindled until more daring animation surfaced in the late and in the early with hit series such as the simpsons since as part of a renaissance of american animation

while us animated series also spawned successes internationally many other countries produced their own programming relatively often preferring stop motion and puppetry over cel animation japanese anime tv series became very successful internationally since the and european producers looking for affordable cel animators relatively often started with japanese studios resulting in hit series such as barbapapa the vicky the viking and the jungle book tv series




computer animation was gradually developed since the wireframe animation started popping up in the mainstream in the with an early short appearance in the thriller futureworld

the rescuers down under was the first feature film to be completely created digitally without a camera it was produced in a style thats very similar to traditional cel animation on the computer animation production system caps developed by the walt disney company in collaboration with pixar in the late

the style more often associated with computer animation has become extremely popular since pixars toy story the first feature in this style

most of the cel animation studios switched to producing mostly computer animated films around the as it proved cheaper and more profitable not only the very popular animation style was generated with computers but also most of the films and series with a more traditional appearance in which the charming characteristics of cel animation could be emulated with software while new digital tools helped developing new styles and effects


in the animation market was worth billion animated films returned the highest gross margins around of all film genres between and animation as an art and industry continues to thrive as of the early


the clarity of animation makes it a powerful tool for instruction while its total malleability also allows exaggeration that can be employed to convey strong emotions and to thwart reality it has therefore been widely used for other purposes than mere entertainment

during world war ii animation was widely exploited for propaganda world war ii and american animation including warner bros and disney lent their talents and their cartoon characters to convey the public of certain war values some countries including china japan and the united kingdom produced their first animation for their war efforts

animation has been very popular in television commercials both due to its graphic appeal and the humour it can provide some animated characters in commercials have survived for decades such as snap crackle and pop in advertisements for kelloggs crackle rice the legendary animation director tex avery was the producer of the first raid insecticide kills bugs dead commercials in which were very successful for the company


apart from their success in movie theaters and television series many cartoon characters would also prove extremely lucrative when licensed for all kinds of merchandise and for other media

animation has traditionally been very closely related to comic books while many comic book characters found their way to the screen which is often the case in japan where many manga are adapted into anime original animated characters also commonly appear in comic books and magazines somewhat similarly characters and plots for video games an interactive animation medium have been derived from films and vice versa

some of the original content produced for the screen can be used and marketed in other media stories and images can easily be adapted into childrens books and other printed media songs and music have appeared on records and as streaming media

while very many animation companies commercially exploit their creations outside moving image media the walt disney company is the best known and most extreme example since first being licensed for a childrens writing tablet in their mickey mouse mascot has been mickey as have many other disney characters this may have influenced some mickey use of mickeys name but disney consumer products sell well and the disneyana has many avid collectors and even a dedicated disneyana fanclub since

disneyland opened in and features many attractions that were based on disneys cartoon characters its enormous success spawned several other disney parks experiences and resorts the walt disney data from the theme parks have relatively often been higher than those from their movies


criticism of animation has been common in media and cinema since its inception with its popularity a large amount of criticism has arisen especially animated films many concerns of cultural representation psychological effects on children have been brought up around the animation industry which has remained rather politically unchanged and stagnant since its inception into mainstream culture



as with any other form of media animation has instituted awards for excellence in the field the original awards for animation were presented by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences for animated shorts from the year during the academy awards function the first winner of the academy awards was the short flowers and trees a production by walt disney productions the academy award for a animated motion picture was only instituted for the year and awarded during the academy awards in it was won by the film shrek produced by dreamworks animation and pacific data images walt disney animation studios and pixar has produced the most films either to win or be nominated for the award beauty and the beast film was the first animated film nominated for best picture up film and toy story also received best picture nominations after the academy expanded the number of nominees from five to ten



several other countries have instituted an award for the feature film as part of their national film awards africa movie academy award for best animation since bafta award for best animated film since award for best animated film since golden rooster award for best animation since goya award for best animated film since japan academy prize for animation of the year since national film award for best animated film since also since the asia pacific screen award for best animated feature film has been awarded at the asia pacific screen awards since the european film awards have awarded the european film award for best animated film

the annie award is another award presented for excellence in the field of animation unlike the academy awards the annie awards are only received for achievements in the field of animation and not for any other field of technical and artistic endeavour they were in to create a new field for best animated feature the winners were dominated by walt however newer studios led by pixar dreamworks have now begun to consistently vie for this award the list of awardees is as follows






the creation of animation works ie longer than a few seconds has developed as a form of filmmaking with certain unique aspects traits common to both and animated feature film are labor intensity and high production costs

the most important difference is that once a film is in the production phase the marginal cost of one more shot is higher for animated films than films it is relatively easy for a director to ask for one more take during principal photography of a film but every take on an animated film must be manually rendered by animators although the task of rendering slightly different takes has been made less tedious by modern computer animation it is pointless for a studio to pay the salaries of dozens of animators to spend weeks creating a visually dazzling scene if that scene fails to effectively advance the plot of the film thus animation studios starting with disney began the practice in the of maintaining story departments where storyboard artists develop every single scene through storyboards then handing the film over to the animators only after the production team is satisfied that all the scenes make sense as a whole while films are now also storyboarded they enjoy more latitude to depart from storyboards ie improvisation

another problem unique to animation is the requirement to maintain a films consistency from start to finish even as films have grown longer and teams have grown larger animators like all artists necessarily have individual styles but must subordinate their individuality in a consistent way to whatever style is employed on a particular film since the early teams of about to people of whom to are animators typically have created animated films it is relatively easy for two or three artists to match their synchronizing those of dozens of artists is more difficult

this problem is usually solved by having a separate group of visual development artists develop an overall look and palette for each film before the animation begins character designers on the visual development team draw model sheets to show how each character should look like with different facial expressions posed in different positions and viewed from different angles on traditionally animated projects maquettes were often sculpted to further help the animators see how characters would look from different angles

unlike films animated films were traditionally developed beyond the synopsis stage through the storyboard the storyboard artists would then receive credit for writing the film in the early animation studios began hiring professional screenwriters to write screenplays while also continuing to use story departments and screenplays had become commonplace for animated films by the late





traditional animation also called cel animation or animation was the process used for most animated films of the century the individual frames of a traditionally animated film are photographs of drawings first drawn on paper to create the illusion of movement each drawing differs slightly from the one before it the animators drawings are traced or photocopied onto transparent acetate sheets called cels which are filled in with paints in assigned colors or tones on the side opposite the line drawings the completed character cels are photographed against a painted background by a rostrum camera onto motion picture film

the traditional cel animation process became obsolete by the beginning of the century today animators drawings and the backgrounds are either scanned into or drawn directly into a computer system various software programs are used to color the drawings and simulate camera movement and effects the final animated piece is output to one of several delivery media including traditional mm movie film and newer media with digital video the look of traditional cel animation is still preserved and the character animators work has remained essentially the same over the past years some animation producers have used the term tradigital art a play on the words traditional and digital to describe cel animation that uses significant computer technology

examples of traditionally animated feature films include pinocchio film united states animal farm film united kingdom lucky and zorba italy and the illusionist film traditionally animated films produced with the aid of computer technology include the lion king us the prince of egypt us akira film japan spirited away japan the triplets of belleville france and the secret of kells


full animation refers to the process of producing traditionally animated films that regularly use detailed drawings and plausible movement having a smooth animation fully animated films can be made in a variety of styles from more realistically animated works like those produced by the walt disney animation studios the little mermaid film beauty and the beast film aladdin disney film the lion to the more cartoon styles of the warner bros cartoons many of the disney animated features are examples of full animation as are works the secret of nimh us the iron giant us and nocturna film spain fully animated films are animated at frames per second with a combination of animation on ones and twos meaning that drawings can be held for one frame out of or two frames out of



limited animation involves the use of less detailed or more stylized drawings and methods of movement usually a choppy or skippy movement animation limited animation uses fewer drawings per second thereby limiting the fluidity of the animation this is a more economic technique pioneered by the artists at the american studio united productions of america limited animation can be used as a method of stylized artistic expression as in gerald us yellow submarine film uk and certain anime produced in japan its primary use however has been in producing animated content for media for television the work of filmation and other tv animation studios and later the internet web cartoons



rotoscoping is a technique patented by max fleischer in where animators trace movement frame by frame the source film can be directly copied from actors outlines into animated drawings as in the lord of the rings film us or used in a stylized and expressive manner as in waking life us and a scanner darkly film us some other examples are fire and ice film us heavy metal film and the flowers of evil manga



list of films with live action and animation is a technique combining characters into live action shots or actors into animated shots one of the earlier uses was in koko the clown when koko was drawn over footage walt disney and ub iwerks created a series of alice comedies in which a girl enters an animated world other examples include allegro non troppo italy who framed roger rabbit us volere volare italy space jam us and osmosis jones us



animation is used to describe animation created by physically manipulating objects and photographing them one frame of film at a time to create the illusion of movement there are many different types of animation usually named after the medium used to create the animation computer software is widely available to create this type of traditional animation is usually less expensive but more to produce than current computer animation
















computer animation encompasses a variety of techniques the unifying factor being that the animation is created digitally on a computer animation techniques tend to focus on image manipulation while techniques usually build virtual worlds in which characters and objects move and interact animation can create images that seem real to the viewer





computer graphics figures are created or edited on the computer using raster graphics and vector graphics this includes automated computerized versions of traditional animation techniques interpolation morphing onion skinning and interpolated rotoscoping

animation has many applications including scanimate flash animation and powerpoint animation cinemagraphs are still life photography in the form of an animated gif file of which part is animated

final line advection animation is a technique used in animation to give artists and animators more influence and control over the final product as everything is done within the same department speaking about using this approach in paperman john kahrs said that our animators can change things actually erase away the cg underlayer if they want and change the profile of the arm



animation is digitally modeled and manipulated by an animator the model maker usually starts by creating a polygon mesh for the animator to manipulate a mesh typically includes many vertices that are connected by edges and faces which give the visual appearance of form to a object or environment sometimes the mesh is given an internal digital skeletal structure called an armature computer animation that can be used to control the mesh by weighting the vertices this process is called rigging and can be used in conjunction with key frames to create movement

other techniques can be applied mathematical functions eg gravity particle simulations simulated fur or hair and effects fire and fluid animation these techniques fall under the category of dynamics

the role of apollo as god of plague is evident in the invocation of apollo smintheus mouse apollo by chryses the trojan priest of apollo with the purpose of sending a plague against the greeks the reasoning behind a god of the plague becoming a god of healing is apotropaic meaning that the god responsible for bringing the plague must be appeased in order to remove the plague

apollo in his aspect of healer has a connection to the primitive god paean god who did not have a cult of his own paean serves as the healer of the gods in the iliad and seems to have originated in a religionpaieon puts medicines on the wounds of pluton and ares iliad this art is related with egypt odyssey m nilsson vol i p it is suggested though unconfirmed that he is connected to the mycenaean greece figure linear b at google books paean was the personification of holy songs sung by which were supposed to cure disease which is sung to stop the plagues and the diseases proklos chrestom from photios bibl code p martin nilsson die geschicthe der griechischen religion vol i p

homer illustrated paeon the god and the song both of apotropaic thanksgiving or triumph such songs were originally addressed to apollo and afterwards to other gods to dionysus to apollo helios to apollos son asclepius the healer about the century bce the paean became merely a formula of its object was either to implore protection against disease and misfortune or to offer thanks after such protection had been rendered it was in this way that apollo had become recognized as the god of music apollos role as the slayer of the python mythology led to his association with battle and hence it became the ancient rome custom for a paean to be sung by an army on the march and before entering into battle when a fleet left the harbour and also after a victory had been won

in the iliad apollo is the healer under the gods but he is also the bringer of disease and death with his arrows similar to the function of the vedic god of disease rudrathe conception that the diseases come from invisible shots sent by magicians or supernatural beings is common in primitive people and also in european folklore in they speak of the in sweden where the lapps were called magicians they speak of the martin nilsson vol i p he sends a plague to the achaeans homer knowing that apollo can prevent a recurrence of the plague he sent they purify themselves in a ritual and offer him a large sacrifice of cows called a hecatombiliad a martin nilsson vol i p

a origin of apollo has long been assumed in scholarship the name of apollos mother leto has lydian origin and she was worshipped on the coasts of asia minor the inspiration oracular cult was probably introduced into greece from anatolia which is the origin of sibyl and where some of the oldest oracular shrines originated omens symbols purifications and exorcisms appear in old texts these rituals were spread into the empire of the hittites and from there into greecemartin p nilsson die geschichte der griechische religion vol i pp

apollos cult religion was already fully established when written sources commenced about bce apollo became extremely important to the greek world as an oracular deity in the archaic greece and the frequency of theophoric names such as apollodorus or apollonios and cities named apollonia testify to his popularity oracular sanctuaries to apollo were established in other sites in the and century ce those at didyma and claros pronounced the theological oracles in which apollo confirms that all deities are aspects or servants of an pantheism and panentheism in the century apollo fell silent julian the apostate tried to revive the delphic oracle but failed



apollo had a famous oracle in delphi and other notable ones in claros and didyma his oracular shrine in abae in phocis where he bore the toponymic epithet abaeus apollon abaios was important enough to be consulted by croesusherodotus





















many temples were dedicated to apollo in greece and the greek colonies they show the spread of the cult of apollo and the evolution of the greek architecture which was mostly based on the rightness of form and on mathematical relations some of the earliest temples especially in crete do not belong to any greek order it seems that the first peripteral temples were rectangular wooden structures the different wooden elements were considered divinity and their forms were preserved in the marble or stone elements of the temples of doric order the greeks used standard types because they believed that the world of objects was a series of typical forms which could be represented in several instances the temples should be canon basic principle and the architects were trying to achieve this esthetic perfectionto know what a thing is we must know the look of it rhys carpenter the esthetic basis of greek art indiana university press p from the earliest times there were certain rules strictly observed in rectangular peripteral and prostyle buildings the first buildings were built narrowly in order to hold the roof and when the dimensions changed some mathematical relations became necessary in order to keep the original forms this probably influenced the theory of numbers of pythagoras who believed that behind the appearance of things there was the permanent principle of mathematicsc m bowra the greek experience p

the doric order dominated during the and the century bc but there was a mathematical problem regarding the position of the triglyphs which couldnt be solved without changing the original forms the order was almost abandoned for the ionic order but the ionic capital also posed an insoluble problem at the corner of a temple both orders were abandoned for the corinthian order gradually during the hellenistic age and under rome










































apollo appears often in the myths plays and hymns as zeus favorite son apollo had direct access to the mind of zeus and was willing to reveal this knowledge to humans a divinity beyond human comprehension he appears both as a beneficial and a wrathful god

python was sent by hera to hunt the pregnant leto to death and had assaulted her to avenge the trouble given to his mother apollo went in search of python and killed it in the sacred cave at delphi with the bow and arrows that he had received from hephaestus the delphian nymphs who were present encouraged apollo during the battle with the cry hie paean after apollo was victorious they also brought him gifts and gave the corycian cave to himchildren of the gods by kenneth mcleish page according to homer apollo had encountered and killed the python when he was looking for a place to establish his shrine

according to another version when leto was in delphi python had attacked her apollo defended his mother and killed pythoneuripides iphigenia in tauris euripides in his iphigenia in aulis gives an account of his fight with python and the events aftermath
you killed him o phoebus while still a baby still leaping in the arms of your dear mother and you entered the holy shrine and sat on the golden tripod on your truthful throne distributing prophecies from the gods to mortals

a detailed account of apollos conflict with gaia and zeus intervention on behalf of his young son is also given
but when apollo came and sent themis the child of earth away from the holy oracle of pytho earth gave birth to dream visions of the and they told to the cities of men the present and what will happen in the future through dark beds of sleep on the and so earth took the office of prophecy away from phoebus in envy because of her daughter the lord made his swift way to olympus and wound his baby hands around zeus asking him to take the wrath of the earth goddess from the pythian home zeus smiled that the child so quickly came to ask for worship that pays in gold he shook his locks of hair put an end to the night voices and took away from mortals the truth that appears in darkness and gave the privilege back again to loxias
apollo also demanded that all other methods of divination be made inferior to his a wish that zeus granted him readily because of this athena who had been practicing divination by throwing pebbles cast her pebbles away in displeasurejohn opsopaus the oracles of apollo practical ancient greek divination for today

apollo and the furies argue about whether the matricide was apollo holds that the bond of marriage is sacred and orestes was avenging his father whereas the erinyes say that the bond of blood between mother and son is more meaningful than the bond of marriage they invade his temple and he drives them away he says that the matter should be brought before athena apollo promises to protect orestes as orestes has become apollos supplication apollo advocates orestes at the trial and ultimately athena rules in favor of apollo



the roman worship of apollo was adopted from the greeks as a quintessentially list of greek mythological figures apollo had no direct roman equivalent although later roman poets often referred to him as phoebus there was a tradition that the delphic oracle was consulted as early as the period of the roman kingdom during the reign of tarquinius superbuslivy

on the occasion of a pestilence in the bce apollos temple of apollo sosianus at rome was established in the flaminian fields replacing an older cult site there known as the apollinarelivy during the second punic war in bce the ludi apollinares apollonian games were instituted in his honor on the instructions of a prophecy attributed to one marciuslivy in the time of augustus who considered himself under the special protection of apollo and was even said to be his son his worship developed and he became one of the chief gods of rome

in literary contexts apollo represents harmony order and contrasted with those of dionysus god of wine who represents ecstasy and disorder the contrast between the roles of these gods is reflected in the adjectives apollonian and dionysian however the greeks thought of the two qualities as complementary the two gods are brothers and when apollo at winter left for hyperborea he would leave the delphic oracle to dionysus this contrast appears to be shown on the two sides of the borghese vase

the rivalry has been called the greatest of the generation of players competing in the as pete sampras and agassi were the most successful players of that decade they also had very contrasting playing styles with sampras being considered the greatest serve tennis and agassi the greatest serve returner at the time agassi and sampras met times on the tour level with agassi trailing

the us open tennis was their first meeting in a grand slam tournament final agassi was favored as he was ranked no at the time compared to the no ranking of sampras and because agassi had defeated sampras in their only previously completed match agassi however lost the final to sampras in straight sets their next meeting in a grand slam was at the french open where they met in the quarterfinals although sampras was ranked higher agassi came out winning in straight sets they met again on a grand slam level at the quarterfinals of wimbledon in where agassi was the defending champion and sampras was the newly minted world no agassi dug himself out from a hole levelling the match at sets however sampras prevailed in five sets and went on to win his first wimbledon championship

with both sampras and agassi participating the usa davis cup team won the davis cup in the year should be considered the peak of the rivalry as together they won out of major titles meeting each other twice in the finals and were occupying the top two spots in the rankings for the whole year they met times during the year all in the title matches including the australian open the indian wells masters now indian wells the lipton international players championships now miami open the canada masters and the us open tennis agassi won three of the finals including the australian however sampras took the us open title ending agassis winning streak after agassi had taken most of the fall season off sampras took over the no ranking for the end of the season

in the following years while sampras continued winning grand slam titles every season agassi slumped in the rankings and struggled in major competitions the next time sampras and agassi met in a grand slam final was at wimbledon in where sampras won in straight sets for both it was considered a career rejuvenation as sampras had suffered a string of disappointments in the previous year while agassi was regaining his status as a player after winning the french open sampras forfeited the no ranking to agassi when injury forced him to withdraw from that years us open which agassi went on to win they faced each other twice in the tennis masters cup with sampras losing the match but winning the final

in the they met three more times on the grand slam level offering three memorable contests in the agassi defeated no sampras in the of the australian open in five sets which was an important win for agassi who had lost of the previous matches against sampras in arguably their most memorable match ever sampras defeated agassi in the us open tennis quarterfinals in four sets there were no breaks of serve during the entire match reruns of the match are frequently featured on television especially during us open rain delays and the match is considered one of the best in history because of the level of play presented by both players

their last meeting was the final of the us open tennis which was their third meeting in a us open final but the first since the match was also notable because they had defeated several players en route to the final sampras had defeated no tommy haas in the fourth round and future no andy roddick in the quarterfinals while agassi had defeated no and defending champion lleyton hewitt in the sampras defeated agassi in four sets this was the final atp tour singles match of samprass career



michael chang was the opponent agassi faced most frequently from all the players other than sampras they met times on the tour level with agassi leading chang unlike most of agassis big rivals had a playing style similar to his both players preferred to stay at the baseline with chang being more the outcome was that most of their meetings were built on long and entertaining rallies the rivalry began late in the with both players being considered the prodigies of the next great generation of american tennis players and both having foreign descent

agassi won the first four matches including a victory in round of the us open and defeating chang the defending champion in the french open in a quarterfinal arguably their best match took place in the round of of the us open while both players presented the momentum changed from set to set with agassi eventually prevailing in a victory it turned out to be the toughest contest on his way to his first us open title their next two grand slam meetings came in with chang recording easy victories in the of both the australian open and the us open years after agassi shockingly admitted in his book that he had lost the first of the matches on purpose as he did not want to face boris becker who was awaiting the winner in the final agassi won the last four of their matches with the last being in at the miami open with chang being clearly past his prime



boris becker and agassi played times with agassi leading becker won their first three matches in and before agassi reversed the rivalry in and won of their last matches they first played at indian wells in with becker prevailing their most notable match was the davis cup match which becker won in five sets after losing the first two in tiebreaks agassi considered a baseliner with a playing style not suiting grass shocked becker a champion in a quarterfinal at wimbledon in on his way to his first grand slam title the intensity of the rivalry peaked in becker won that years wimbledon after being down a set and two breaks to eventually win in four sets in a highly anticipated rematch in the us open this time it was agassi who came out victorious in four tight sets their final match was played at hong kong in which agassi won in three sets



agassi and pat rafter played fifteen times with agassi leading the rivalry has been considered special and delivered memorable encounters because of the players contrasting styles of play with rafter using traditional methods against agassis variety of return of serves and passing shots as his main weapons agassi led on hard courts but rafter surprisingly won their sole match on clay at the italian open tennis they played four matches at the championships wimbledon with both winning two matches each agassi won the first two in and while rafter took their and encounters both of the gruelling often being presented on the lists of best matches ever played agassi also won both their meetings at the australian open in and on his way to the title on both occasions rafter however took their only us open encounter in and went on to win the title



agassi and roger federer played times and federer led their series with the retirement of sampras the rivalry against the federer who was another great server like sampras became agassis main rivalry for the final years of his career agassi won their first three matches but then went on to lose eight consecutive ones they first met in just the third tournament of federers career at the swiss indoors in federers hometown with agassi prevailing over the agassi also defeated federer at the us open tennis and the finals of the miami open tennis in federer began to turn the tide at the masters cup in when he defeated agassi in both the round robin and the final they played a memorable quarterfinal match at the us open tennis that spanned over two windy days with federer eventually prevailing in five sets at the dubai championships federer and agassi attracted worldwide headlines with a publicity stunt that saw the two tennis legends play on a helipad almost meters above sea level at the hotel burj their final duel took place in the final of the us open tennis in the historic clash of generations federer was victorious in four sets in front of a crowd the match was the last appearance by agassi in any tournament final

early in his career agassi would look to end points quickly by playing tennis typically by inducing a weak return with a deep hard shot and then playing a winner at an extreme angle on the rare occasion that he charged the net agassi liked to take the ball in the air and hit a swinging volley for a winner his favored groundstroke was his flat accurate backhand hit well but especially down the line his forehand was nearly as strong especially his to the ad court

agassis strength was in dictating play from the baseline and he was able to consistently take the ball on the rise while he was growing up his father and nick bollettieri trained him in this wayopen andre agassi harperscollins when in control of a point agassi would often pass up an opportunity to attempt a winner and hit a conservative shot to minimize his errors and to make his opponent run more this change to more methodical less aggressive baseline play was largely initiated by his longtime coach brad gilbert in their first year together in gilbert encouraged agassi to wear out opponents with his deep flat groundstrokes and to use his fitness to win attrition wars and noted agassis backhand down the line as his very best shot a signature play later in his career was a change up drop shot to the deuce court after deep penetrating groundstrokes this would often be followed by a passing shot or lob if the opponent was fast enough to retrieve it

the austroasiatic languages also known as notes mk in the wider sense including the munda languages of eastern south asia is also known as austroasiatic are a large language family of mainland southeast asia also scattered throughout parts of india bangladesh nepal and southern china there are around million speakers of austroasiatic languages of these languages only vietnamese language khmer language and mon language have a recorded history and only vietnamese and khmer have official status as modern national languages in vietnam and cambodia respectively the mon language is a recognized indigenous language in myanmar and thailand in myanmar the wa language is the de facto official language of wa state santali language is one of the eighth schedule to the constitution of india the rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status

ethnologue identifies austroasiatic languages these form thirteen established families plus perhaps shompen language which is poorly attested as a fourteenth which have traditionally been grouped into two as and munda languages however one recent classification posits three groups munda nuclear and languagesdiffloth while another has abandoned as a taxon altogether making it synonymous with the larger familysidwell

austroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across southeast asia and parts of india bangladesh nepal and east asia separated by regions where other languages are spoken they appear to be the extant indigenous language of mainland southeast asia excluding the andaman islands with the neighboring languages languages austronesian languages and languages being the result of later migrations


the name austroasiatic comes from a combination of the latin words for south and asia hence south asia


regarding word structure austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic sesquisyllable pattern with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial unstressed reduced minor syllable followed by a stressed full syllable this reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original prefixes such as the causative prefix ranging from cvc syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants as for word formation most austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes many have infixes but suffixes are almost completely in most branches except munda and a few specialized exceptions in other austroasiatic branchesalves

the austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of register phonology contrast either between modal voice normal voice and breathy voice lax voice or between modal voice and creaky voicediffloth creaky voice languages in the pearic branch and some in the vietic branch can have a or even voicing contrast

however some austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases such as vietnamese tonogenesis vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by chinese that its original austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of south chinese languages whereas khmer which had more influence from sanskrit has retained a more typically austroasiatic structure



much work has been done on the reconstruction of in harry l shortos comparative dictionary little work has been done on the munda languages which are not well documented with their demotion from a primary branch becomes synonymous with paul sidwell reconstructs the consonant inventory of as follows















this is identical to earlier reconstructions except for is better preserved in the katuic languages which sidwell has specialized in


linguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of austroasiatic the languages of southeast asia india and the nicobar islands and the munda languages of east india and central india and parts of bangladesh parts of nepal however no evidence for this classification has ever been published

each of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade by contrast the relationships between these families within austroasiatic are debated in addition to the traditional classification two recent proposals are given neither of which accepts traditional as a valid unit however little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review

in addition there are suggestions that additional branches of austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of acehnese language in sumatra diffloth the chamic languages of vietnam and the land dayak languages of borneo adelaar blench are there four additional unrecognised branches of presentation at bangkok october summarized in sidwell and blench


diffloths widely cited original classification now abandoned by diffloth himself is used in britannica for the breakup of southern ethnologue

























peiros is a lexicostatistics classification based on percentages of shared vocabulary this means that languages can appear to be more distantly related than they actually are due to language contact indeed when sidwell replicated peiross study with languages known well enough to account for loans he did not find the internal branching structure below


























diffloth compares reconstructions of various clades and attempts to classify them based on shared innovations though like other classifications the evidence has not been published as a schematic we have

































































































paul sidwell in a lexicostatistical comparison of languages which are well known enough to exclude loan words finds little evidence for internal branching though he did find an area of increased contact between the bahnaric and katuic languages such that languages of all branches apart from the geographically distant munda languages and nicobarese show greater similarity to bahnaric and katuic the closer they are to those branches without any noticeable innovations common to bahnaric and katuic

he therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence sidwell roger blench discuss this proposal in more detail and note that there is good evidence for a node which could also possibly be closely related to khmuicsidwell paul and roger blench the austroasiatic urheimat the southeastern riverine hypothesis enfield nj ed dynamics of human diversity canberra pacific linguistics

if this would the case sidwell blench suggest that khasic may have been an early offshoot of palaungic that had spread westward sidwell blench suggest shompen language as an additional branch and believe that a connection is worth investigating in general however the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed since speakers are believed by sidwell to have radiated out from the central mekong river valley relatively quickly
























subsequently sidwell paul austroasiatic classification in jenny mathias and paul sidwell eds the handbook of austroasiatic languages leiden brill proposed that nicobarese languages subgroups with aslian languages just as how khasian and palaungic subgroup with each other a subsequent computational phylogenetic analysis of the austroasiatic language family by sidwell paul a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of the austroasiatic languages presented at diversity linguistics retrospect and prospect may leipzig germany closing conference of the department of linguistics at the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology suggests that austroasiatic branches may have a loosely nested structure rather than a completely structure with an division consisting of munda khasic palaungic and khmuic forming a western group as opposed to all of the other branches occurring possibly as early as years before present

integrating computational phylogenetic linguistics with recent archaeological findings paul sidwell paul phylogeny innovations and correlations in the prehistory of austroasiatic paper presented at the workshop integrating inferences about our past new findings and current issues in the peopling of the pacific and south east asia june max planck institute for the science of human history jena germany further expanded his mekong riverine hypothesis by proposing that austroasiatic had ultimately expanded into indochina from the lingnan area of southern china with the subsequent mekong riverine dispersal taking place after the initial arrival of neolithic farmers from southern china

sidwell tentatively suggests that austroasiatic may have begun to split up years bp during the neolithic transition era of mainland southeast asia with all the major branches of austroasiatic formed by bp austroasiatic would have had two possible dispersal routes from the western periphery of the pearl river china watershed of lingnan which would have been either a coastal route down the coast of vietnam or downstream through the mekong river via yunnan both the reconstructed lexicon of and the archaeological record clearly show that early austroasiatic speakers around bp cultivated rice and millet kept livestock such as dogs pigs and chickens and thrived mostly in estuarine rather than coastal environments

at bp this neolithic package suddenly arrived in indochina from the lingnan area without cereal grains and displaced the earlier cultures with grain husks found in northern indochina by bp and in southern indochina by bp however sidwell found that iron is not reconstructable in since each austroasiatic branch has different terms for iron that had been borrowed relatively lately from tai chinese tibetan malay and other languages

during the iron age about bp relatively young austroasiatic branches in indochina such as vietic languages katuic languages pearic languages and khmer language were formed while the more internally diverse bahnaric languages branch dating to about bp underwent more extensive internal diversification by the iron age all of the austroasiatic branches were more or less in their locations with most of the diversification within austroasiatic taking place during the iron age

paul sidwell paul austroasiatic deep chronology and the problem of cultural lexicon paper presented at the annual meeting of the southeast asian linguistics society held may in kaohsiung taiwan considers the austroasiatic language family to have rapidly diversified around years bp during the arrival of rice agriculture in indochina but notes that the origin of itself is older than that date the lexicon of can be divided into an early and late stratum the early stratum consists of basic lexicon including body parts animal names natural features and pronouns while the names of cultural items agriculture terms and words for cultural artifacts which are reconstructable in form part of the later stratum

roger blench roger waterworld lexical evidence for aquatic subsistence strategies in austroasiatic presented at icaal kiel germany suggests that vocabulary related to aquatic subsistence strategies such as boats waterways river fauna and fish capture techniques can be reconstructed for blench finds widespread austroasiatic roots for river valley boat fish catfish sp eel prawn shrimp central austroasiatic crab tortoise turtle otter crocodile heron fishing bird and fish trap archaeological evidence for the presence of agriculture in northern indochina northern vietnam laos and other nearby areas dates back to only about years bp bc with agriculture ultimately being introduced from further up to the north in the yangtze valley where it has been dated to bp

hence this points to a relatively late riverine dispersal of austroasiatic as compared to languages whose speakers had a distinct culture in addition to living an lifestyle early austroasiatic speakers would have also had access to livestock crops and newer types of watercraft as early austroasiatic speakers dispersed rapidly via waterways they would have encountered speakers of older language families who were already settled in the area such as


roger blench roger are there four additional unrecognised branches of also proposes that there might have been other primary branches of austroasiatic that are now extinct based on stratum linguistics evidence in languages









john peterson john the prehistorical spread of in south asia presented at icaal kiel germany suggests that languages languages may have once dominated the eastern plain and were then absorbed by languages at an early date as spread east peterson notes that eastern languages display many morphosyntactic features similar to those of munda languages while western languages do not


other than alphabets many austroasiatic languages are written with the khmer alphabet thai alphabet lao alphabet and burmese alphabet alphabets vietnamese divergently had an indigenous script based on chinese logographic writing this has since been supplanted by the latin alphabet in the century the following are examples of alphabets or current alphabets of austroasiatic languages

















austroasiatic is an integral part of the controversial austric languages which also includes the austronesian languages and in some proposals also the languages and the languages

it is suggested that the austroasiatic languages have some influence on languages including sanskrit and middle languages indian linguist suniti kumar chatterji pointed that a specific number of substantives in languages such as hindi punjabi language and bengali language were borrowed from munda languages additionally french linguist jean przyluski suggested a similarity between the tales from the austroasiatic realm and the indian mythological stories of satyavati from mahabharata and the

in the early century linguists grouped the berber languages cushitic languages and egyptian language languages within a hamitic phylum in acknowledgement of these languages genetic relationship linguistics with each other and with those in the semitic languages phylum the terms hamitic and semitic were etymologically derived from the book of genesis which describes various biblical tribes descended from ham son of noah and shem two sons of noah by the the main constituent elements within the broader afroasiatic family had been worked out

friedrich linguist introduced the name for the entire language family in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft maurice delafosse later coined the term afroasiatic often now spelled however it did not come into general use until joseph greenberg formally proposed its adoption in doing so greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that hamitic was not a valid group and that language cladistics did not reflect racegerrit dimmendaal language ecology and linguistic diversity on the african continent language and linguistics compass

individual scholars have also called the family erythraean tucker and lisramic hodge in lieu of the russian linguist igor diakonoff later suggested the term afrasian meaning half african half asiatic in reference to the geographic distribution of the familys constituent languages

the term remains in use in the academic traditions of some european countries as well as in the official census of the government of india




scholars generally treat the afroasiatic language family as including the following five branches whereas omotic is disputed







although there is general agreement on these six families linguistics who study afroasiatic raise some points of disagreement in particular









in descending order of the number of speakers afroasiatic languages include

























in the century the hebrew grammarian judah ibn kuraish of tiaret in algeria was the first to link two branches of afroasiatic he perceived a relationship between berber and semitic he knew of semitic through his study of arabic hebrew and aramaic in the course of the century europeans also began suggesting such relationships in theodor benfey suggested a language family consisting of semitic berber and cushitic calling the latter ethiopic in the same year tn newman suggested a relationship between semitic and hausa but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty

friedrich linguist named the traditional family in in his grundriss der sprachwissenschaft outline of linguistics and defined it as consisting of a semitic group plus a hamitic group containing egyptian berber and he excluded the chadic group it was the egyptology karl richard lepsius who restricted hamitic to the languages in africa which are characterized by a grammatical grammatical gender this hamitic language group was proposed to unite various mainly languages including the ancient egyptian language the berber languages the cushitic languages the beja language and the chadic languages unlike lepsius considered that hausa language and nama language were part of the hamitic group these classifications relied in part on anthropological and racial arguments both authors used the mode of subsistence and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped togethermerritt ruhlen a guide to the worlds languages classification stanford university press pp

in carl meinhof published die sprachen der hamiten the languages of the hamites in which he expanded lepsiuss model adding the fula language maasai language bari language nandi languages sandawe language and hadza language languages to the hamitic group meinhofs model was widely supported in the meinhofs system of classification of the hamitic languages was based on a belief that speakers of hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially caucasian origins intrinsically different from and superior to the negroes of africakevin shillington encyclopedia of african history crc press however in the case of the languages a concept he introduced it was based on the typological feature of gender and a fallacious theory of mixed language meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as lepsius and johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub were in fact nilotic languages with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other nilotic languagesmerritt ruhlen a guide to the worlds languages stanford university press

leo reinisch had already proposed linking cushitic and chadic while urging their more distant affinity with egyptian and semitic however his suggestion found little acceptance marcel cohen rejected the idea of a distinct hamitic subgroup and included hausa language a chadic language in his comparative vocabulary finally joseph greenbergs work led to the widespread rejection of hamitic as a language category by linguists greenberg refuted meinhofs linguistic theories and rejected the use of racial and social evidence in dismissing the notion of a separate language category in particular greenberg was returning to a view widely held a earlier he consequently rejoined meinhofs languages with their appropriate nilotic siblings he also added and the chadic languages and proposed the new name afroasiatic for the family almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus

greenbergs model was fully developed in his book the languages of africa in which he reassigned most of meinhofs additions to hamitic to other language families notably following isaac schapera and rejecting meinhof he classified the hottentot language as a member of the khoisan languages a grouping that has since proven inaccurate and excessively motivated on the presence of click consonant to khoisan he also added the tanzanian hadza language and sandawe language though this view has been discredited as linguists working on these languages consider them to be language isolatesands bonny e eastern and southern african khoisan evaluating claims of distant linguistic relationships quellen zur despite this greenbergs classification remains a starting point for modern work of many languages spoken in africa and the hamitic category and its extension to has no part in this

since the three traditional branches of the hamitic languages berber cushitic and egyptian have not been shown to form an exclusive monophyly phylogenetic unit of their own separate from other afroasiatic languages linguists no longer use the term in this sense each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger afroasiatic family

in harold c fleming proposed that what had previously been known as western cushitic is an independent branch of afroasiatic suggesting for it the new name omotic languages this proposal and name have met with widespread acceptance

based on typological differences with the other cushitic languages robert hetzron proposed that beja has to be removed from cushitic thus forming an independent branch of afroasiatic most scholars however reject this proposal and continue to group beja as the sole member of a northern branch within cushitic

glottolog does not accept that the inclusion or even unity of omotic has been established nor that of ongota or the unclassified kujarge it therefore splits off the following groups as small families south omotic languages mao languages dizoid languages languages north omotic apart from the preceding ongota language kujarge language



























































































little agreement exists on the subgrouping linguistics of the five or six branches of afroasiatic semitic egyptian berber chadic cushitic and omotic however christopher ehret harold fleming and joseph greenberg all agree that the omotic branch split from the rest first











afroasiatic is one of the four major languages of africa spoken in africa identified by joseph greenberg in his book the languages of africa it is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental with languages from afroasiatics semitic branch also spoken in the middle east and europe

there are no generally accepted relations between afroasiatic and any other language family however several proposals grouping afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made the of these are the following







the earliest written evidence of an afroasiatic language is an egyptian language inscription dated to c bc years ago symbols on gerzeh culture naqada ii pottery resembling egyptian and evolution date back to c bc suggesting an earlier possible dating this gives us a minimum date for the age of afroasiatic however ancient egyptian is highly divergent from language trombetti and considerable time must have elapsed in between them estimates of the date at which the language was spoken vary widely they fall within a range between approximately bc years ago and approximately bc years ago according to igor m diakonoff was spoken circa bc christopher ehret asserts that was spoken c bc at the latest and possibly as early as c bc these dates are older than those associated with other




the afroasiatic urheimat the hypothetical place where language speakers lived in a single linguistic community or complex of communities before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages is unknown afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in western asia north africa the horn of africa and parts of the sahel their distribution seems to have been influenced by the sahara pump theory operating over the last years

there is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed the main theories of urheimat are the crescent the eastern saharablench r archaeology language and the african past rowman altamira m black athena the afroasiatic roots of classical civilization rutgers university press ml upside down afrasian afrikanistische arbeitspapiere pp a once more about glottochronology and comparative method the case aspects of comparative linguistics fs s starostin orientalia et classica ii moscow p north africa and the horn of africa


















































widespread though not universal features of the afroasiatic languages include








one of the most remarkable shared features among the afroasiatic languages is the prefixing verb conjugation see the table at the start of this section with a distinctive pattern of prefixes beginning with t n and in particular a pattern whereby masculine is opposed to feminine and

according to ehret tonal languages appear in the omotic and chadic branches of afroasiatic as well as in certain cushitic languages the semitic berber and egyptian branches generally do not use tones phoneme

the berber and semitic branches share certain grammatical features eg alternative feminine endings corresponding vowel templates for verbal conjugations which can be reconstructed for a provisionally called by kossmann suchard and putten whether this is ancestral to berber and semitic only or also to other branches of afroasiatic still remains to be established






the following are some examples of afroasiatic cognates including ten pronouns three nouns and three verbs















































there are two etymological dictionaries of afroasiatic one by christopher ehret and one by vladimir orel and olga stolbova the two dictionaries disagree on almost everything the following table contains the thirty roots or so out of thousands that represent a fragile consensus of present research












































































































































































































































































































andorra officially the principality of andorra is a sovereignty landlocked microstate on the iberian peninsula in the eastern pyrenees bordered by france to the north and spain to the south believed to have been created by charlemagne andorra was ruled by the count of urgell until when it was transferred to the roman catholic diocese of urgell the present principality was formed by of andorra it is headed by two the bishop of urgell in spain and the president of the french republic

andorra does not have its own armed forces although there is a small ceremonial army responsibility for defending the nation rests primarily with france and spain however in case of emergencies or natural disasters the sometent an alarm is called and all men between and of andorran nationality must serve this is why all andorrans and especially the head of each house usually the eldest man of a house should by law keep a rifle even though the law also states that the police will offer a firearm in case of need andorra is a full member of the united nations un the organization for security and in europe osce and has a special agreement with the european union eu it also has observer status at the world trade organization wto on october andorra became the member of the international monetary fund imf during the pandemic


andorra has a small army which has historically been raised or reconstituted at various dates but has never in modern times amounted to a standing army the basic principle of andorran defence is that all men are available to fight if called upon by the sounding of the sometent being a landlocked country andorra has no navy

before world war i andorra maintained an armed force of about militiamen under the supervision of a captain or cap de sometent and a lieutenant desener or lloctinent del this body was not liable for service outside the principality and was commanded by two officials veguers appointed by france and the bishop of urgell

in the modern era the army has consisted of a very small body of volunteers willing to undertake ceremonial duties uniforms and weaponry were handed down from generation to generation within families and communities

the armys role in internal security was largely taken over by the formation of the police corps of andorra in brief civil disorder associated with the elections of led to assistance being sought from the french national gendarmerie with a detachment resident in andorra for two months under the command of baulard the andorran police was reformed in the following year with eleven soldiers appointed to supervisory roles the force consisted of six corporals one for each parish although there are currently seven parishes there were only six until plus four junior staff officers to action and a commander with the rank of major it was the responsibility of the six corporals each in his own parish to be able to raise a fighting force from among the men of the parish

today a small ceremonial unit remains the only permanent section of the sometent but all men remain technically available for military service with a requirement for each family to have access to a firearm a shotgun per household is unregulated rifles and pistols require a license the army has not fought for more than years and its main responsibility is to present the flag of andorra at official ceremonial functions according to marc andorras military budget is strictly from voluntary donations and the availability of volunteers

in more recent times there has only been a general emergency call to the popular army of sometent during the floods of in the catalan pyrenees where citizens perished in andorra to help the population and establish a public order along with the local police units




andorra maintains a small but modern and internal police force with around police officers supported by civilian assistants the principal services supplied by the corps are uniformed community policing criminal detection border control and traffic policing there are also small specialist units including police dogs mountain rescue and a bomb disposal team


the grup policia dandorra gipa is a small special forces unit trained in and hostage negotiator tasks although it is the closest in style to an active military force it is part of the police corps of andorra and not the military of andorra as terrorist and hostage situations are a rare threat to the country the gipa is commonly assigned to prisoner escort duties and at other times to routine policing


the andorran fire brigade with headquarters at santa coloma dandorra operates from four modern fire stations and has a staff of around firefighters the service is equipped with heavy appliances fire tenders turntable ladders and specialist drive vehicles four light support vehicles cars and vans and four ambulances

in mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean stress on first and third syllables of arithmetic or simply the mean or the average when the context is clear is the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the count of numbers in the collection the collection is often a set of results of an experiment or an observational study or frequently a set of results from a survey statistics the term arithmetic mean is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other averages such as the geometric mean and the harmonic mean

in addition to mathematics and statistics the arithmetic mean is used frequently in many diverse fields such as economics anthropology and history and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent for example per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nations population

while the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendency it is not a robust statistic meaning that it is greatly influenced by outliers values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values for skewed distributions such as the distribution of income for which a few peoples incomes are substantially greater than most peoples the arithmetic mean may not coincide with ones notion of middle and robust statistics such as the median may provide better description of central tendency


given a data set x the arithmetic mean or mean or average denoted read x bar is the mean of the n values

the arithmetic mean is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency in a data set in statistics the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency the arithmetic mean of a set of observed data is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations symbolically if we have a data set consisting of the values then the arithmetic mean a is defined by the formula





for example consider the monthly salary of employees of a firm the arithmetic mean is



if the data set is a statistical population ie consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them then the mean of that population is called the population mean and denoted by the greek alphabet if the data set is a sampling statistics a subset of the population then we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a sample mean which for a data set x is denoted as

the arithmetic mean can be similarly defined for vector mathematics and physics in multiple dimension not only scalar mathematics this is often referred to as a centroid more generally because the arithmetic mean is a convex combination coefficients sum to it can be defined on a convex space not only a vector space



the arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful especially as a measure of central tendency these include






the arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median the median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than and no more than half are smaller than the median if elements in the data arithmetic progression when placed in some order then the median and arithmetic average are equal for example consider the data sample the average is as is the median however when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically such as the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly in this case the arithmetic average is while the median is in general the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample and can be larger or smaller than most of them

there are applications of this phenomenon in many fields for example since the the median income in the united states has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income





a weighted average or weighted mean is an average in which some data points count more heavily than others in that they are given more weight in the for example the arithmetic mean of and is or equivalently in contrast a weighted mean in which the first number receives for example twice as much weight as the second perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled would be calculated as here the weights which necessarily sum to the value one are and the former being twice the latter the arithmetic mean sometimes called the unweighted average or equally weighted average can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other equal to in the above example and equal to in a situation with n numbers being averaged





if a numerical property and any sample of data from it could take on any value from a continuous range instead of for example just integers then the probability of a number falling into some range of possible values can be described by integrating a continuous probability distribution across this range even when the naive probability for a sample number taking one certain value from infinitely many is zero the analog of a weighted average in this context in which there are an infinite number of possibilities for the precise value of the variable in each range is called the mean of the probability distribution a most widely encountered probability distribution is called the normal it has the property that all measures of its central tendency including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the mode statistics the are equal to each other this equality does not hold for other probability distributions as illustrated for the lognormal distribution here




particular care must be taken when using cyclic data such as phases or angles naively taking the arithmetic mean of and yields a result of




in general application such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range a solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation viz define the mean as the central point the point about which one has the lowest dispersion and redefine the difference as a modular distance ie the distance on the circle so the modular distance between and is not




the arithmetic mean is often denoted by a bar for example as in read x bar

some software text processing web browsers may not display the symbol properly for example the symbol in html is actually a combination of two codes the base letter x plus a code for the line above or

in some texts such as pdf the symbol may be replaced by a euro coins symbol unicode when copied to text processor such as microsoft word


































































the american football conference afc is one of the two athletic conference of the national football league nfl the highest professional level of american football in the united states this conference currently contains teams organized into division sport as does its counterpart the national football conference nfc both conferences were created as part of the merger between the national football league and the american football league afl all ten of the afl teams and three nfl teams became members of the new afc with the remaining thirteen nfl teams forming the nfc a series of league expansions and division realignments have occurred since the merger thus making the current total of teams in each conference the current afc champions are the kansas city chiefs who defeated the buffalo bills in the afc championship game for their second consecutive conference championship


like the nfc the conference has teams organized into four division sport each with four teams afc east afc north afc south and afc west

























































































































this chart of the nfl season standings displays an application of the nfl scheduling formula the kansas city chiefs season highlighted in green finished in first place in the afc west thus kansas city chiefs season the chiefs are scheduled to play two games against each of its division rivals highlighted in light blue one game against each team in the afc north and nfc east highlighted in yellow and one game each against the finishers in the afc east and afc south highlighted in orange


currently the thirteen opponents each team faces over the regular season schedule are set using a formula

each afc team plays the other teams in their respective division twice home and away during the regular season in addition to other games assigned to their schedule by the nfl two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular teams final divisional standing from the previous season the remaining games are split between the roster of two other nfl divisions this assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle using the regular season schedule as an example each team in the afc west plays against every team in the afc north and nfc south in this way competition will be mostly among common opponents the exception being the two games assigned based on the teams divisional standing

at the end of each season the four division winners and three wild card sports winners with best regular season record in the afc qualify for the national football league playoffs the afc playoffs culminate in the afc championship game with the winner receiving the lamar hunt trophy the afc champion then plays the national football conference champion in the super bowl



both the afc and the nfc were created after the nfl merger with the american football league afl in the afl began play in with eight teams and added two more expansion clubs the miami dolphins in and the cincinnati bengals in before the merger in order to equalize the number of teams in each conference three nfl teams that predated the afls launch the cleveland browns pittsburgh steelers and the colts joined the ten former afl teams to form the afc the two afl divisions afl east and afl west were more or less intact while the nfls national football league century division in which the browns and the steelers had played since was moved from the nfl to become the new afc central upon the completion of the merger of the afl and nfl in the newly minted american football conference had already agreed upon their divisional setup along mostly geographical lines for the nfl the national football conference however could not agree upon their setup and one was chosen from a fishbowl on january

since the merger five expansion teams have joined the afc and two have left thus making the current total when the seattle seahawks and the tampa bay buccaneers joined the league in they were temporarily placed in the nfc and afc respectively this arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences the seahawks eventually returned to the nfc as a result of the nfl and realignment the expansion jacksonville jaguars joined the afc in there have been five teams that have relocated at least once in the history of the baltimore colts baltimore colts relocation to indianapolis to indianapolis in the cleveland browns had attempted to move to the resulting cleveland browns relocation controversy between cleveland and the team led to modell establishing the baltimore ravens with the players and personnel from the browns while the browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the nfl the ravens were treated as an expansion team

in california the oakland raiders relocated to los angeles in back to oakland in and then to las vegas in while the history of the san diego chargers returned to los angeles in after years in san diego

the history of the houston oilers moved to tennessee in where they were renamed the tennessee oilers the team would change its name again two years later to the tennessee titans

the nfl would again expand in adding the houston texans to the afc with the exception of the aforementioned relocations since that time the divisional setup has remained static ever since

between and the afc has sent only half of its teams to the super bowl new england patriots times denver broncos times pittsburgh steelers times baltimore ravens times indianapolis colts times kansas city chiefs time las vegas raiders time and tennessee titans time by contrast the national football conference has sent of the nfc teams during that same time frame with only the detroit lions minnesota vikings and washington football team missing out on an appearance in the super bowl of the last afc champions have started one of just three quarterbacks tom brady peyton manning and ben roethlisberger in the super bowl the afc has started quarterbacks in the last super bowls while the nfc has started


football conference logo american football conference logo used from to
the merged league created a new logo for the afc that took elements of the old afl logo specifically the a and the six stars surrounding it the afc logo basically remained unchanged from to the nfl season introduced an updated afc logo with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars leaving four representing the four divisions of the afc and moving the stars inside the letter similar to the nfc logo


nfl on nbc aired the afcs sunday afternoon and playoff games from through the season from to nfl on cbs was the primary broadcast rightsholder to the in those years all interconference games in which the afc team was the visiting team were broadcast on either nbc or cbs since the policy allows select afc games that involve them playing an nfc team at home or intraconference games to be moved from cbs to fox since select afc playoffs games have been seen on abc or espn



























































































































animal farm is an allegory novella by george orwell first published in england on august the book tells the story of a group of farm animals who rebel against their human farmer hoping to create a society where the animals can be equal free and happy ultimately however the rebellion is betrayed and the farm ends up in a state as bad as it was before under the dictatorship of a pig named napoleon animal farm

according to orwell the fable reflects events leading up to the russian revolution of and then on into the history of the soviet union of the soviet union orwell a democratic socialism was a critic of joseph stalin and hostile to stalinism an attitude that was critically shaped by his experiences during the may days conflicts between the poum and stalinist forces during the spanish civil war the soviet union had become a totalitarian autocracy built upon a cult of personality while engaging in the practice of mass incarcerations and secret summary trials and executions in a letter to yvonne davet orwell described animal farm as a satire tale against stalin and in his essay why i write wrote that animal farm was the first book in which he tried with full consciousness of what he was doing to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole

the original title was animal farm a fairy story but us publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in and only one of the translations during orwells lifetime kept it other titular variations include subtitles like a satire and a contemporary satire orwell suggested the title for the french translation which abbreviates to ursa the latin word for bear a russian bear it also played on the french name of the soviet union

orwell wrote the book between november and february when the united kingdom was in its allies of world war ii with the soviet union against nazi germany and the british intelligentsia held stalin in high esteem a phenomenon orwell hated the manuscript was initially rejected by a number of british and american publishers including one of orwells own victor gollancz which delayed its publication it became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the cold war

time magazine chose the book as one of the best novels to it also featured at number on the modern library list of best novels and number on the bbcs the big read poll the big read bbc april retrieved march it won a in and is included in the great books of the western world selection the book was widely disseminated by information research department for whom orwell prepared orwells list


the manor farm near willingdon and jevington england is ripened for rebellion from its animal populace by neglect at the hands of the irresponsible and alcoholic farmer jones animal farm one night the exalted boar old major holds a conference at which he calls for the overthrow of humans and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called beasts of england when old major dies two young pigs snowball animal farm and napoleon animal farm assume command and stage a revolt driving mr jones off the farm and renaming the property animal farm they adopt the seven commandments of animalism the most important of which is all animals are equal the decree is painted in large letters on one side of the barn snowball teaches the animals to read and write while napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of to commemorate the start of animal farm snowball raises a green flag with a white hoof and horn food is plentiful and the farm runs smoothly the pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items ostensibly for their personal health following an unsuccessful attempt by mr jones and his associates to retake the farm later dubbed the battle of the cowshed snowball announces his plans to modernise the farm by building a windmill napoleon disputes this idea and matters come to head which culminate in napoleons dogs chasing snowball away and napoleon declaring himself supreme commander

napoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm through a young porker named squealer animal farm napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea claiming that snowball was only trying to win animals to his side the animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill when the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm napoleon and squealer persuade the animals that snowball is trying to sabotage their project and begin to purge the farm of animals napoleon accuses of consorting with his old rival when some animals recall the battle of the cowshed napoleon who was nowhere to be found during the battle gradually smears snowball to the point of saying he is a collaborator of mr jones even dismissing the fact that snowball was given an award of courage while falsely representing himself as the main hero of the battle beasts of england is replaced with animal farm while an anthem glorifying napoleon who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man comrade napoleon is composed and sung napoleon then conducts a second purge during which many animals who claim to be helping snowball in plots are executed by napoleons dogs which troubles the rest of the animals despite their hardships the animals are easily placated by napoleons retort that they are better off than they were under mr jones as well as by the sheeps continual bleating of legs good two legs

mr frederick a neighbouring farmer attacks the farm using explosive material to blow up the restored windmill although the animals win the battle they do so pyrrhic victory as many including boxer animal farm are wounded although he recovers from this boxer eventually collapses while working on the windmill being almost years old at that point he is taken away in a knackers van and a donkey called benjamin alerts the animals of this but squealer quickly waves off their alarm by persuading the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital and that the previous owners signboard had not been repainted squealer subsequently reports boxers death and honours him with a festival the following day however napoleon had in fact engineered the sale of boxer to the knacker allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy whisky for themselves


years pass the windmill is rebuilt and another windmill is constructed which makes the farm a good amount of income however the ideals that snowball discussed including stalls with electric lighting heating and running water are forgotten with napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives snowball has been forgotten alongside boxer with the exception of the few who knew him many of the animals who participated in the rebellion are dead or old mr jones is also dead saying he died in an inebriates home in another part of the country the pigs start to resemble humans as they walk upright carry whips drink alcohol and wear clothes the seven commandments are abridged to just one phrase all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others the maxim four legs good two legs bad is similarly changed to four legs good two legs better other changes include the hoof and horn flag being replaced with a plain green banner and old majors skull which was previously put on display being reburied

napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers with whom he celebrates a new alliance he abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name the manor farm the men and pigs start playing cards flattering and praising each other while cheating at the game both napoleon and mr pilkington one of the farmers play the ace of spades at the same time and both sides begin fighting loudly over who cheated first when the animals outside look at the pigs and men they can no longer distinguish between the two



































george orwells animal farm is an example of a political satire that was intended to have a wider application according to orwell himself in terms of its relevance stylistically the work shares many similarities with some of orwells other works most notably as both have been considered works of swiftian satire furthermore these two prominent works seem to suggest orwells bleak view of the future for he seems to stress the threat of dystopias similar to those in animal farm and in these kinds of works orwell distinctly references the disarray and traumatic conditions of europe following the second world and the english orwells style and writing philosophy as a whole were very concerned with the pursuit of truth in orwell was committed to communicating in a way that was straightforward given the way that he felt words were commonly used in politics to deceive and confuse for this reason he is careful in animal farm to make sure the narrator speaks in an unbiased and uncomplicated fashion the difference is seen in the way that the animals speak and interact as the generally moral animals seem to speak their minds clearly while the wicked animals on the farm such as napoleon twist language in such a way that it meets their own insidious desires this style reflects orwells close proximation to the issues facing europe at the time and his determination to comment critically on stalins soviet russia




george orwell wrote the manuscript between november and february after his experiences during the spanish civil war which he described in homage to catalonia in the preface of a ukrainian edition of animal farm he explained how escaping the communist purges in spain taught him how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic orwells preface to the ukrainian edition of animal farm the orwell this motivated orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the stalinist corruption of the original socialist ideals homage to catalonia sold after seeing arthur koestlers darkness at noon about the moscow trials orwell decided that fiction was the best way to describe totalitarianism

immediately prior to writing the book orwell had quit the bbc he was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the ministry of information had put out the booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the soviet union such as directions to claim that the red terror was a figment of nazi imagination

in the preface orwell described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm




in the manuscript was almost lost when a german flying bomb destroyed his london home orwell spent hours sifting through the rubble to find the pages intact




orwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between britain the united states and the soviet union four publishers refused to publish animal farm yet one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the ministry of information united kingdom eventually secker and warburg published the first edition in

during the world war ii it became clear to orwell that literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch including his regular publisher victor gollancz ltd he also submitted the manuscript to faber and faber where the poet t s eliot who was a director of the firm rejected eliot wrote back to orwell praising the books good writing and fundamental integrity but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint which i take to be generally deformed workers state eliot said he found the view not convincing and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the he posited that someone might argue what was needed was not more communism but more pigs orwell let deutsch who was working for nicholson watson in read the typescript and deutsch was convinced that nicholson watson would want to publish however they did not and lectured orwell on what they perceived to be errors in animal farm in his london letter on april for partisan review orwell wrote that it was now next door to impossible to get anything overtly printed books do appear but mostly from catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle

the publisher jonathan cape who had initially accepted animal farm subsequently rejected the book after an official at the british ministry of information warned him off although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a soviet union spy writing to leonard moore literary agent a partner in the literary agency of christy moore publisher jonathan cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the ministry of information such flagrant bias was unacceptable and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive it may reasonably be assumed that the important official was a man named peter smollett who was later unmasked as a soviet agent orwell was suspicious of and he would be one of the names orwell orwells list of and sent to the information research department in the publisher wrote to orwell saying

if the fable were addressed generally to dictators and dictatorships at large then publication would be all right but the fable does follow as i see now so completely the progress of the russian soviets and their two dictators lenin and stalin that it can apply only to russia to the exclusion of the other dictatorships

another thing it would be less offensive if the predominant caste in the fable were not pigs i think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy as undoubtedly the russians are


frederic warburg also faced pressures against publication even from people in his own office and from his wife pamela who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards stalin and the heroic red army which had world war ii casualties of the soviet union in defeating adolf hitler a russian translation was printed in the paper posev and in giving permission for a russian translation of animal farm orwell refused in advance all royalties a translation in ukrainian which was produced in germany was confiscated in large part by the american wartime authorities and handed over to the soviet repatriation commission

in october orwell wrote to frederic warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist david low cartoonist might illustrate animal farm low had written a letter saying that he had had a good time with animal farm an excellent bit of satire it would illustrate perfectly nothing came of this and a trial issue produced by secker warburg in illustrated by john driver was abandoned but the folio society published an edition in illustrated by quentin blake and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist ralph steadman was published by secker warburg in to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of animal farm


orwell originally wrote a preface complaining about british and how the british people were suppressing criticism of the ussr their world war ii ally

although the first edition allowed space for the preface it was not included and as of june most editions of the book have not included it

secker and warburg published the first edition of animal farm in without an introduction however the publisher had provided space for a preface in the authors proof composited from the manuscript for reasons unknown no preface was supplied and the page numbers had to be renumbered at the last minute

in ian angus librarian found the original typescript titled the freedom of the press and bernard crick published it together with his own introduction in the times literary supplement on september as how the essay came to be written orwells essay criticised british by the press specifically the suppression of unflattering descriptions of stalin and the soviet government the same essay also appeared in the italian edition of animal farm with another introduction by crick claiming to be the first edition with the preface other publishers were still declining to publish it


contemporary reviews of the work were not universally positive writing in the american the new republic magazine george soule expressed his disappointment in the book writing that it puzzled and saddened me it seemed on the whole dull the allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their inspirations and said it seems to me that the failure of this book commercially it is already assured of tremendous success arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well

the guardian on august called animal farm a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few tosco fyvel writing in tribune magazine on the same day called the book a gentle satire on a certain state and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us julian symons responded on september should we not expect in tribune at least acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular state soviet it seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify napoleon with stalin and snowball with trotsky and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author upon a political ground in a hundred years time perhaps animal farm may be simply a fairy today it is a political satire with a good deal of point animal farm has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks

the cia from to in operation aedinosaur sent millions of balloons carrying copies of the novel into poland hungary and czechoslovakia whose air forces tried to shoot the balloons down

time magazine chose animal farm as one of the best novels to it also featured at number on the modern library list of best novels it won a in and is included in the great books of the western world selection

popular reading in schools animal farm was ranked the nations favourite book from school in a uk poll

animal farm has also faced an array of challenges in school settings around the us the following are examples of this controversy that has existed around orwells work







animal farm has also faced similar forms of resistance in other countries the ala also mentions the way that the book was prevented from being featured at the international book fair in moscow russia in and banned from schools in the united arab emirates for references to practices or actions that defy arab or islamic beliefs such as pigs or alcohol

in the same manner animal farm has also faced relatively recent issues in china in the government made the decision to censor all online posts about or referring to animal bans george orwells animal farm and letter n from online posts as censors bolster xi jinpings plan to keep however the book itself as of remains sold in stores amy hawkins and jeffrey wasserstrom of the atlantic stated in that the book is widely available in mainland china for several reasons the general public by and large no longer reads books because the elites who do read books feel connected to the ruling party anyway and because the communist party sees being too aggressive in blocking cultural products as a liability the authors stated it easy to buy and animal farm in shenzhen or shanghai as it is in london or los angeles
an enhanced version of the book launched in india in was widely praised for capturing the authors intent by republishing the proposed preface of the first edition and the preface he wrote for the ukrainian edition






the pigs snowball napoleon and squealer adapt old majors ideas into a complete system of thought which they formally name animalism an allegoric reference to communism not to be confused with animalism philosophy soon after napoleon and squealer partake in activities associated with the humans drinking alcohol sleeping in beds trading which were explicitly prohibited by the seven commandments squealer is employed to alter the seven commandments to account for this humanisation an allusion to the soviet governments revising of history in order to exercise control of the peoples beliefs about themselves and their society




whatever goes upon four legs or has wings is a friend






these commandments are also distilled into the maxim four legs good two legs which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of animalism

later napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of the changed commandments are as follows with the changes bolded





eventually these are replaced with the maxims all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others and four legs good two legs better as the pigs become more human this is an irony twist to the original purpose of the seven commandments which were supposed to keep order within animal farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans evil habits through the revision of the commandments orwell demonstrates how simply political dogma can be turned into malleable propaganda



orwell biographer jeffrey meyers has written virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory orwell himself wrote in of course i intended it primarily as a satire on the russian revolution and that kind of revolution violent conspiratorial revolution led by unconsciously people can only lead to a change of masters revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert in a preface for a ukrainian edition he stated the past ten years i have been convinced that the destruction of the soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement on my return from spain in i thought of exposing the soviet myth in a story that could be easily understood by almost anyone and which could be easily translated into other languages

the revolt of the animals against farmer jones is orwells analogy with the october revolution the battle of the cowshed has been said to represent the allied intervention in the russian civil war of russian sfsr in and the defeat of the white movement in the russian civil war the pigs rise to preeminence mirrors the rise of a stalinist bureaucracy in the ussr just as napoleons emergence as the farms sole leader reflects stalins emergence the pigs appropriation of milk and apples for their own use the turning point of the story as orwell termed it in a letter to dwight macdonald stands as an analogy for the crushing of the kronstadt rebellion against the bolsheviks and the difficult efforts of the animals to build the windmill suggest the various plans for the national economy of the soviet union the puppies controlled by napoleon parallel the nurture of the secret police in the stalinist structure and the pigs treatment of the other animals on the farm recalls the internal terror faced by the populace in the in chapter seven when the animals confess their crimes and are killed orwell directly alludes to the purges confessions and moscow show trials of the late these contributed to orwells conviction that the bolshevik revolution had been corrupted and the soviet system become rotten

peter edgerly firchow and peter davison professor contend that the battle of the windmill specifically referencing the battle of stalingrad and the battle of moscow represents world war ii during the battle orwell first wrote all the animals including napoleon took cover orwell had the publisher alter this to all the animals except napoleon in recognition of stalins decision to remain in moscow during the german advance orwell requested the change after he met czapski in paris in march czapski a survivor of the katyn massacre and an opponent of the soviet regime told orwell as orwell wrote to arthur koestler that it had been the character and greatness of stalin that saved russia from the german invasion



other connections that writers have suggested illustrate orwells telescoping of russian history from to include the wave of rebelliousness that ran through the countryside after the rebellion which stands for the abortive revolutions hungarian revolution of and german revolution of ch the conflict between napoleon and snowball ch v parallelling the two rival and beliefs that seemed pitted against one another trotskyism with its faith in the permanent revolution of the proletariat of the and stalinism with its glorification of socialism in one napoleons dealings with whymper and the willingdon markets ch vi paralleling the treaty of rapallo and fredericks forged bank notes parallelling the treaty of between germany and the soviet union after which frederick attacks animal farm without warning and destroys the windmill

the books close with the pigs and men in a kind of rapprochement reflected orwells view of the tehran conference that seemed to display the establishment of the best possible relations between the ussr and the west but in reality were destined as orwell presciently predicted to continue to unravel the disagreement between the allies and the start of the cold war is suggested when napoleon and pilkington both suspicious played an ace of spades simultaneously

similarly the music in the novel starting with beasts of england and the later anthems parallels the internationale and its adoption and repudiation by the soviet authorities as the anthem of the ussr in the and



animal farm has been adapted to film twice both differ from the novel and have been accused of taking significant liberties including sanitising some aspects



in an version of animal farm was announced andy serkis is directing the film after netflix acquired the rights in


a bbc radio version produced by rayner heppenstall was broadcast in january orwell listened to the production at his home in canonbury square london with hugh gordon porteus amongst others orwell later wrote to heppenstall that porteous who had not read the book grasped what was happening after a few minutes

a further radio production again using orwells own dramatisation of the book was broadcast in january on bbc radio four tamsin greig narrated and the cast included nicky henson as napoleon toby jones as the propagandist squealer and ralph ineson as boxer


a theatrical version with music by richard peaslee and lyrics by adrian mitchell was staged at the royal national theatre london on april directed by peter hall director it toured nine cities in

a solo version adapted and performed by guy masterson at the traverse theatre edinburgh in january and has toured worldwide since

a new theatrical stage adaptation is in development alan menken and glenn slater will write songs for the musical with the book written by james graham playwright alan menken and glenn slater confirm theyre working on animal farm musical with james graham



in norman pett and his writing partner don freeman were secretly hired by the information research department a secret wing of the british foreign office to adapt animal farm into a comic strip this comic was not published in the uk but ran in brazilian and burmese newspapers














































































































































































amphibians are ectothermic tetrapod vertebrates of the class biology amphibia all living amphibians belong to the group lissamphibia they inhabit a wide variety of habitats with most species living within terrestrial animal fossorial arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this

the young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult form with lungs amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin they are superficially similar to lizards but along with mammals and birds reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often ecological in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe

the earliest amphibians evolution of tetrapods in the devonian period from sarcopterygian fish with lungs and fins features that were helpful in adapting to dry land they diversified and became dominant during the carboniferous and permian periods but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates over time amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity leaving only the modern subclass lissamphibia

the three modern orders of amphibians are anura frog the frogs and toads urodela the salamanders and caecilian the caecilians the number of known amphibian species is approximately of which nearly are frogs the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis with a length of just the largest living amphibian is the south china giant salamander andrias sligoi but this is dwarfed by the extinct prionosuchus from the guadalupian of brazil the study of amphibians is called batrachology while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called herpetology





the word amphibian is derived from the ancient greek term which means both kinds of life meaning of both kinds and meaning life the term was initially used as a general adjective for animals that could live on land or in water including seals and otters traditionally the class amphibia includes all tetrapod vertebrates that are not amniotes amphibia in its widest sense sensu lato was divided into three class biology two of which are extinct









the actual number of species in each group depends on the taxonomic classification followed the two most common systems are the classification adopted by the website amphibiaweb university of california berkeley and the classification by herpetology darrel frost and the american museum of natural history available as the online reference database amphibian species of the world the numbers of species cited above follows frost and the total number of known amphibian species as of march is exactly of which nearly are frogs

with the phylogenetics classification the taxon labyrinthodontia has been discarded as it is a paraphyly group without unique defining features apart from classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a definitions of clade classification traditionally amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians frogs salamanders and caecilians and all their descendants is called lissamphibia the phylogeny of paleozoic amphibians is uncertain and lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups like the temnospondyli traditionally placed in the subclass labyrinthodontia or the lepospondyli and in some analyses even in the amniotes this means that advocates of phylogenetic nomenclature have removed a large number of basal phylogenetics devonian and carboniferous tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in amphibia in linnaean taxonomy and included them elsewhere under cladistic taxonomy if the common ancestor of amphibians and amniotes is included in amphibia it becomes a paraphyletic group

all modern amphibians are included in the subclass lissamphibia which is usually considered a clade a group of species that have evolved from a common ancestor the three modern orders are anura the frogs and toads caudata or urodela the salamanders and gymnophiona or apoda the caecilians it has been suggested that salamanders arose separately from a ancestor and even that caecilians are the sister group of the advanced reptiliomorpha amphibians and thus of amniotes although the fossils of several older with primitive characteristics are known the oldest true frog is prosalirus bitis from the early jurassic kayenta formation of arizona it is anatomically very similar to modern frogs the oldest known caecilian is another early jurassic species eocaecilia micropodia also from arizona the earliest salamander is beiyanerpeton jianpingensis from the late jurassic of northeastern china

authorities disagree as to whether salientia is a superorder that includes the order anura or whether anura is a of the order salientia the lissamphibia are traditionally divided into three order biology but an extinct family the albanerpetontidae is now considered part of lissamphibia alongside the superorder salientia furthermore salientia includes all three recent orders plus the triassic triadobatrachus




















the first major groups of amphibians developed in the devonian period around million years ago from sarcopterygii which were similar to the modern coelacanth and lungfish these ancient fish had evolved fins with digits that enabled them to crawl along the sea bottom some fish had developed primitive lungs that help them breathe air when the stagnant pools of the devonian swamps were low in oxygen they could also use their strong fins to hoist themselves out of the water and onto dry land if circumstances so required eventually their bony fins would evolution into limbs and they would become the ancestors to all tetrapods including modern amphibians reptiles birds and mammals despite being able to crawl on land many of these prehistoric tetrapodomorph fish still spent most of their time in the water they had started to develop lungs but still breathed predominantly with gills

many examples of species showing transitional fossil have been discovered ichthyostega was one of the first primitive amphibians with nostrils and more efficient lungs it had four sturdy limbs a neck a tail with fins and a skull very similar to that of the fish eusthenopteron amphibians evolved adaptations that allowed them to stay out of the water for longer periods their lungs improved and their skeletons became heavier and stronger better able to support the weight of their bodies on with the increased gravitational effect of life the gravitational force is effectively the same on the surface of the land as in the however in water a body experiences a buoyancy they developed hands and feet with five or more the skin became more capable of retaining body fluids and resisting desiccation the fishs hyomandibula bone in the hyoid bone region behind the gills diminished in size and became the stapes of the amphibian ear an adaptation necessary for hearing on dry land an affinity between the amphibians and the teleost fish is the structure of the teeth and the paired occipital bone at the back of the head neither of these features being found elsewhere in the animal kingdom


at the end of the devonian period million years ago the seas rivers and lakes were teeming with life while the land was the realm of early plants and devoid of vertebrates though some such as ichthyostega may have sometimes hauled themselves out of the water it is thought they may have propelled themselves with their forelimbs dragging their hindquarters in a similar manner to that used by the elephant seal in the early carboniferous to million years ago the climate became wet and warm extensive swamps developed with mosses ferns horsetails and calamites arthropods evolved and invaded the land where they provided food for the carnivore amphibians that began to adapt to the terrestrial environment there were no other tetrapods on the land and the amphibians were at the top of the food chain occupying the ecological position currently held by the crocodile though equipped with limbs and the ability to breathe air most still had a long tapering body and strong tail they were the top land predators sometimes reaching several metres in length preying on the large insects of the period and the many types of fish in the water they still needed to return to water to lay their eggs and even most modern amphibians have a fully aquatic larval stage with gills like their fish ancestors it was the development of the amniote egg which prevents the developing embryo from drying out that enabled the reptiles to reproduce on land and which led to their dominance ecology in the period that followed

after the carboniferous rainforest collapse amphibian dominance gave way to reptiles and amphibians were further devastated by the extinction event during the triassic to million years ago the reptiles continued to the amphibians leading to a reduction in both the amphibians size and their importance in the biosphere according to the fossil record lissamphibia which includes all modern amphibians and is the only surviving lineage may have branched off from the extinct groups temnospondyli and lepospondyli at some period between the late carboniferous and the early triassic the relative scarcity of fossil evidence precludes precise dating but the most recent molecular study based on multilocus sequence typing suggests a late origin for extant amphibians


the origins and evolutionary relationships between the three main groups of amphibians is a matter of debate a molecular phylogeny based on ribosomal dna analysis suggests that salamanders and caecilians are more closely related to each other than they are to frogs it also appears that the divergence of the three groups took place in the paleozoic or early mesozoic around million years ago before the breakup of the supercontinent pangaea and soon after their divergence from the fish the briefness of this period and the swiftness with which radiation took place would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils there are large gaps in the fossil record but the discovery of a gerobatrachus hottoni from the early permian in texas in provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs molecular phylogenetics suggests that the divergence took place considerably earlier than the paleontology evidence indicates newer research indicates that the common ancestor of all lissamphibians lived about million years ago and that stereospondyli are the closest relatives to the caecilians tiny fossils reveal backstory of the most mysterious amphibian alive

as they evolved from lunged fish amphibians had to make certain adaptations for living on land including the need to develop new means of locomotion in the water the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward but on land quite different mechanisms were required their vertebral columns limbs limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding terrestrial adults discarded their lateral line systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air they needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature they developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment their skins were exposed to harmful ultraviolet rays that had previously been absorbed by the water the skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss


the superclass tetrapoda is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs reptiles birds and mammals are amniotes the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes some of which are impervious lacking these membranes amphibians require water bodies for reproduction although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage they are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in brackish water in mangrove the andersons salamander meanwhile occurs in brackish or salt water lakesbrad oscar gabriela david wake ambystoma andersoni iucn red list of threatened species version international union for conservation of nature on land amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp

modern amphibians have a simplified anatomy compared to their ancestors due to neoteny caused by two evolutionary trends miniaturization and an unusually large genome which result in a slower growth and development rate compared to other vertebrates the ecology and behavior of amphibians biological scaling problems and solutions in amphibians ncbi another reason for their size is associated with their rapid metamorphosis which seems to have evolved only in the ancestors of in all other known lines the development was much more gradual because a remodeling of the feeding apparatus means they dont eat during the metamorphosis the metamorphosis has to go faster the smaller the individual is so it happens at an early stage when the larvae are still small the largest species of salamanders dont go through a metamorphosis amphibian evolution the life of early land vertebrates amphibians that lay eggs on land often go through the whole metamorphosis inside the egg an anamniotic terrestrial egg is less than in diameter due to diffusion problems a size which puts a limit on the amount of posthatching growth

the smallest amphibian and vertebrate in the world is a microhylid frog from new guinea paedophryne amauensis first discovered in it has an average length of and is part of a genus that contains four of the worlds ten smallest frog species the largest living amphibian is the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus but this is a great deal smaller than the largest amphibian that ever extinct prionosuchus a temnospondyl dating to million years ago from the middle permian of brazil the largest frog is the african goliath frog conraua goliath which can reach and weigh

amphibians are ectothermic vertebrates that do not maintain their body temperature through internal physiology processes their basal metabolic rate is low and as a result their food and energy requirements are limited in the adult state they have tear ducts and movable eyelids and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations they have muscular tongues which in many species can be protruded modern amphibians have fully ossification vertebrae with articular processes their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales apart from a few scales in certain caecilians the skin contains many mucous glands and in some species skin a type of granular gland the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atrium heart and one ventricle heart they have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults amphibians breathe by means of a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal membrane region through the nostrils these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin



the order anura frog from the ancient greek privative a meaning without and oura meaning tail comprises the frogs and toads they usually have long hind limbs that fold underneath them shorter forelimbs webbed toes with no claws no tails large eyes and glandular moist skin members of this order with smooth skins are commonly referred to as frogs while those with wiktwarty skins are known as toads the difference is not a formal one taxonomically and there are numerous exceptions to this rule members of the family bufonidae are known as the true toads frogs range in size from the goliath frog conraua goliath of west africa to the paedophryne amauensis first described in papua new guinea in which is also the smallest known vertebrate although most species are associated with water and damp habitats some are specialised to live in trees or in deserts they are found worldwide except for polar areas

anura is divided into three suborders that are broadly accepted by the scientific community but the relationships between some families remain unclear future molecular genetics studies should provide further insights into their evolutionary relationships the suborder archaeobatrachia contains four families of primitive frogs these are ascaphidae bombinatoridae discoglossidae and leiopelmatidae which have few derived features and are probably paraphyletic with regard to other frog lineages the six families in the more evolutionarily advanced suborder mesobatrachia are the fossorial megophryidae pelobatidae pelodytidae scaphiopodidae and rhinophrynidae and the obligatorily aquatic pipidae these have certain characteristics that are intermediate between the two other suborders neobatrachia is by far the largest suborder and includes the remaining families of modern frogs including most common species percent of the over extant species of frog are neobatrachians




the order caudata from the latin cauda meaning tail consists of the animals that mostly resemble lizards in form this is a symplesiomorphy and they are no more closely related to lizards than they are to mammals salamanders lack claws have skins either smooth or covered with tubercles and tails that are usually flattened from side to side and often finned they range in size from the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus which has been reported to grow to a length of to the diminutive thorius pennatulus from mexico which seldom exceeds in length salamanders have a mostly laurasian distribution being present in much of the holarctic region of the northern hemisphere the family plethodontidae is also found in central america and south america north of the amazon south america was apparently invaded from central america by about the start of the miocene million years ago urodela is a name sometimes used for all the extant taxon species of salamanders members of several salamander families have become neoteny and either fail to complete their metamorphosis or retain some larval characteristics as adults most salamanders are under long they may be terrestrial or aquatic and many spend part of the year in each habitat when on land they mostly spend the day hidden under stones or logs or in dense vegetation emerging in the evening and night to forage for worms insects and other invertebrates



the suborder cryptobranchoidea contains the primitive salamanders a number of fossil cryptobranchids have been found but there are only three living species the chinese giant salamander andrias davidianus the japanese giant salamander andrias japonicus and the hellbender cryptobranchus alleganiensis from north america these large amphibians retain several larval characteristics in their adult gills slits are present and the eyes are unlidded a unique feature is their ability to feed by suction depressing either the left side of their lower jaw or the right the males excavate nests persuade females to lay their egg strings inside them and guard them as well as breathing with lungs they respire through the many folds in their thin skin which has capillary close to the surface

the suborder salamandroidea contains the advanced salamanders they differ from the cryptobranchids by having fused mandible in the lower jaw and by using internal fertilisation in salamandrids the male deposits a bundle of sperm the spermatophore and the female picks it up and inserts it into her cloaca where the sperm is stored until the eggs are laid the largest family in this group is plethodontidae the lungless salamanders which includes of all salamander species the family biology salamandridae includes the true salamanders and the name newt is given to members of its subfamily pleurodelinae

the third suborder sirenoidea contains the four species of sirens which are in a single family sirenidae members of this order are aquatic salamanders with much reduced forelimbs and no hind limbs some of their features are primitive while others are derived fertilisation is likely to be external as sirenids lack the cloacal glands used by male salamandrids to produce spermatophores and the females lack spermathecae for sperm storage despite this the eggs are laid singly a behaviour not conducive for external fertilisation



the order gymnophiona from the greek gymnos meaning naked and ophis meaning serpent or apoda comprises the caecilians these are long cylindrical limbless animals with a or annelid form the adults vary in length from to centimetres to inches with the exception of caecilia thompsoni caecilia thompsoni which can reach a caecilians skin has a large number of transverse folds and in some species contains tiny embedded dermal scales it has rudimentary eyes covered in skin which are probably limited to discerning differences in light intensity it also has a pair of short tentacles near the eye that can be extended and which have somatosensory system and olfaction functions most caecilians live underground in burrows in damp soil in rotten wood and under plant debris but some are aquatic most species lay their eggs underground and when the larvae hatch they make their way to adjacent bodies of water others brood their eggs and the larvae undergo metamorphosis before the eggs hatch a few species give birth to live young nourishing them with glandular secretions while they are in the oviduct caecilians have a mostly gondwanan distribution being found in tropical regions of africa asia and central and south america





the wiktintegument structure contains some typical characteristics common to terrestrial vertebrates such as the presence of highly outer layers renewed periodically through a moulting process controlled by the pituitary gland and thyroid glands local thickenings often called warts are common such as those found on toads the outside of the skin is shed periodically mostly in one piece in contrast to mammals and birds where it is shed in flakes amphibians often eat the sloughed skin caecilians are unique among amphibians in having mineralized dermal scales embedded in the dermis between the furrows in the skin the similarity of these to the scales of bony fish is largely superficial squamata and some frogs have somewhat similar osteoderms forming bony deposits in the dermis but this is an example of convergent evolution with similar structures having arisen independently in diverse vertebrate lineages

amphibian skin is permeable to water gas exchange can take place through the skin cutaneous respiration and this allows adult amphibians to respire without rising to the surface of water and to hibernate at the bottom of ponds to compensate for their thin and delicate skin amphibians have evolved mucous glands principally on their heads backs and tails the secretions produced by these help keep the skin moist in addition most species of amphibian have granular glands that secrete distasteful or poisonous substances some amphibian toxins can be lethal to humans while others have little effect the main glands the parotoid gland produce the neurotoxin bufotoxin and are located behind the ears of toads along the backs of frogs behind the eyes of salamanders and on the upper surface of caecilians

the skin colour of amphibians is produced by three layers of pigment cells called chromatophores these three cell layers consist of the melanophores occupying the deepest layer the guanophores forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules producing a colour and the lipophores yellow the most superficial layer the colour change displayed by many species is initiated by hormones secreted by the pituitary gland unlike bony fish there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish a vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators



amphibians have a skeletal system that is structurally homology biology to other tetrapods though with a number of variations they all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs the bones are hollow and lightweight the musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body the bones are fully ossification and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes the pectoral girdle is supported by muscle and the pelvic girdle is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs the ilium bone slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals


in most amphibians there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot but no claws on either some salamanders have fewer digits and the amphiumas are in appearance with tiny stubby legs the siren genus are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs the caecilians are limbless they burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body on the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side

in frogs the hind legs are larger than the fore legs especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming in the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies the feet have adaptations for the way of life with webbing between the toes for swimming broad adhesive toe pads for climbing and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging frogs usually dig backwards into the soil in most salamanders the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop particularly when climbing in their normal gait only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors the fish some salamanders in the genus aneides and certain lungless salamander climb trees and have long limbs large toepads and prehensile tails in aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles the tail has dorsal fin and ventral fin fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones

salamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as autotomy certain species in the plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily the tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape both tails and limbs can be regenerated adult frogs are unable to regrow limbs but tadpoles can do so




amphibians have a juvenile stage and an adult stage and the circulatory systems of the two are distinct in the juvenile or tadpole stage the circulation is similar to that of a the heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop in the adult stage amphibians especially frogs lose their gills and develop lungs they have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria when the ventricle starts contracting deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers


the nervous system is basically the same as in other vertebrates with a central brain a spinal cord and nerves throughout the body the amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish it is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving pain in amphibians the brain consists of equal parts cerebrum midbrain and cerebellum various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning the cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the medulla oblongata controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration the brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body the pineal body known to regulate sleep patterns in humans is thought to produce the hormones involved in hibernation and aestivation in amphibians

tadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians some caecilians possess electroreception that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water the ears are well developed in frogs there is no external ear but the large circular tympanum anatomy lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye this vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone the stapes to the inner ear only sounds like mating calls are heard in this way but noises can be detected through another mechanism there is a patch of specialized haircells called papilla amphibiorum in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds another feature unique to frogs and salamanders is the complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals the ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound

the eyes of tadpoles lack lids but at metamorphosis the cornea becomes more the lens anatomy becomes flatter and eyelids and associated glands and ducts develop the adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes they allow colour vision and depth of focus in the retinas are green rods which are receptive to a wide range of wavelengths



many amphibians catch their prey by flicking out an elongated tongue with a sticky tip and drawing it back into the mouth before seizing the item with their jaws some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by inertia most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs the short esophagus is lined with cilium that help to move the food to the stomach and mucus produced by glands in the mouth and pharynx eases its passage the enzyme chitinase produced in the stomach helps digest the chitinous cuticle of arthropod prey

amphibians possess a pancreas liver and gall bladder the liver is usually large with two lobes its size is determined by its function as a glycogen and fat storage unit and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up adipose tissue is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen in internal structures called fat bodies under the skin and in some salamanders in the tail


there are two kidneys located dorsally near the roof of the body cavity their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine while terrestrial species with a greater need to conserve water excrete the less toxic product urea some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid



the lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes possessing few internal alveolar septum and large pulmonary alveolus and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood ventilation is accomplished by buccal pumping most amphibians however are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin to enable sufficient cutaneous respiration the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration as in the telmatobius culeus and the cryptobranchus in air where oxygen is more concentrated some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange most famously the plethodontidae which have neither lungs nor gills many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage with some such as the axolotl retaining gills as aquatic adults




for the purpose of biological reproduction most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist a few eg fejervarya raja can inhabit brackish water but there are no true marine ocean amphibians there are reports however of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters such was the case with the black sea invasion of the natural hybrid pelophylax esculentus reported in

several hundred frog species in adaptive radiations eg eleutherodactylus the pacific platymantis the microhylids and many other tropical frogs however do not need any water for breeding in the wild they reproduce via direct development an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from water almost all of these frogs live in wet tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult passing through the tadpole stage within the egg reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall but the seasonal timing

in the tropics many amphibians breed continuously or at any time of year in temperate regions breeding is mostly seasonal usually in the spring and is triggered by increasing day length rising temperatures or rainfall experiments have shown the importance of temperature but the trigger event especially in arid regions is often a storm in anurans males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active

in caecilians fertilisation is internal the male extruding an intromittent organ the and inserting it into the female cloaca the paired glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian prostate glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct

the majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation in most of these the male deposits a spermatophore a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone on the substrate biology either on land or in the water the female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent the spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species in some the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called amplexus certain primitive salamanders in the families sirenidae hynobiidae and cryptobranchidae practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass

with a few exceptions frogs use external fertilisation the male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs or in the case of epipedobates tricolor around the neck they remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm roughened nuptial pads on the males hands aid in retaining grip often the male collects and retains the egg mass forming a sort of basket with the hind feet an exception is the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously the tailed frog ascaphus truei exhibits internal fertilisation the tail is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female this frog lives in streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs the sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the oviduct until the following spring

most frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders typically prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site the males usually arriving first calling and setting up territories other satellite males remain quietly nearby waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory the females arrive sporadically mate selection takes place and eggs are laid the females depart and territories may change hands more females appear and in due course the breeding season comes to an end explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall these frogs are typically wiktfossorial species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site they are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season the assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females




there is a direct competition between males to win the attention of the females in salamanders and newts with elaborate courtship displays to keep the females attention long enough to get her interested in choosing him to mating with some species store sperm through long breeding seasons as the extra time may allow for interactions with rival sperm


most amphibians go through metamorphosis a process of significant morphological change after birth in typical amphibian development eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle frogs toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by thyroxine concentration in the blood which stimulates metamorphosis and prolactin which counteracts thyroxines effect specific events are dependent on threshold values for different kikuyama sakae
















the egg of an amphibian is typically surrounded by a transparent gelatinous covering secreted by the oviducts and containing mucoproteins and mucopolysaccharides this capsule is permeable to water and gases and swells considerably as it absorbs water the ovum is at first rigidly held but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the embryo to move freely this also happens in salamander eggs even when they are unfertilised eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae these penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis they seem to both speed up the development of the larvae and reduce mortality most eggs contain the pigment melanin which raises their temperature through the absorption of light and also protects them against ultraviolet radiation caecilians some plethodontid salamanders and certain frogs lay eggs underground that are unpigmented in the wood frog rana sylvatica the interior of the globular egg cluster has been found to be up to warmer than its surroundings which is an advantage in its cool northern habitat

the eggs may be deposited singly or in small groups or may take the form of spherical egg masses rafts or long strings in terrestrial caecilians the eggs are laid in clusters in burrows near streams the amphibious salamander ensatina attaches its similar clusters by stalks to underwater stems and roots the eleutherodactylus planirostris eleutherodactylus planirostris lays eggs in small groups in the soil where they develop in about two weeks directly into juvenile frogs without an intervening larval stage the tungara frog physalaemus pustulosus builds a floating nest from foam to protect its eggs first a raft is built then eggs are laid in the centre and finally a foam cap is overlaid the foam has properties it contains no detergents but is created by whipping up proteins and lectins secreted by the female



the eggs of amphibians are typically laid in water and hatch into larvae that complete their development in water and later transform into either aquatic or terrestrial adults in many species of frog and in most lungless salamanders plethodontidae direct development takes place the larvae growing within the eggs and emerging as miniature adults many caecilians and some other amphibians lay their eggs on land and the newly hatched larvae wriggle or are transported to water bodies some caecilians the alpine salamander salamandra atra and some of the nectophrynoides nectophrynoides spp are viviparity their larvae feed on glandular secretions and develop within the females oviduct often for long periods other amphibians but not caecilians are ovoviviparity the eggs are retained in or on the parents body but the larvae subsist on the yolks of their eggs and receive no nourishment from the adult the larvae emerge at varying stages of their growth either before or after metamorphosis according to their species the toad genus nectophrynoides exhibits all of these developmental patterns among its dozen or so members


frog larvae are known as tadpoles and typically have oval bodies and long vertically flattened tails with fins the larvae are normally fully aquatic but the tadpoles of some species such as nannophrys ceylonensis are and live among wet rocks tadpoles have cartilaginous skeletons gills for respiration external gills at first internal gills later lateral line systems and large tails that they use for swimming newly hatched tadpoles soon develop gill pouches that cover the gills the lungs develop early and are used as accessory breathing organs the tadpoles rising to the water surface to gulp air some species complete their development inside the egg and hatch directly into small frogs these larvae do not have gills but instead have specialised areas of skin through which respiration takes place while tadpoles do not have true teeth in most species the jaws have long parallel rows of small keratinized structures called keradonts surrounded by a horny beak front legs are formed under the gill sac and hind legs become visible a few days later

iodine and over stimulate the spectacular apoptosis programmed cell death of the cells of the larval gills tail and fins also stimulate the evolution of nervous systems transforming the aquatic vegetarian tadpole into the terrestrial carnivorous frog with better neurological visuospatial olfactory and cognitive abilities for hunting

in fact tadpoles developing in ponds and streams are typically herbivore pond tadpoles tend to have deep bodies large caudal fins and small they swim in the quiet waters feeding on growing or loose fragments of vegetation stream dwellers mostly have larger mouths shallow bodies and caudal they attach themselves to plants and stones and feed on the surface films of algae and bacteria they also feed on diatoms filtered from the water through the gills and stir up the sediment at bottom of the pond ingesting edible fragments they have a relatively long gut to enable them to digest this diet some species are carnivorous at the tadpole stage eating insects smaller tadpoles and fish young of the cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis can occasionally be cannibalism zoology the younger tadpoles attacking a larger more developed tadpole when it is undergoing metamorphosis


at metamorphosis rapid changes in the body take place as the lifestyle of the frog changes completely the mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut the animal develops a large jaw and its gills disappear along with its gill sac eyes and legs grow quickly and a tongue is formed there are associated changes in the neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system all this can happen in about a day a few days later the tail is reabsorbed due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place





at hatching a typical salamander larva has eyes without lids teeth in both upper and lower jaws three pairs of feathery external gills a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with anatomical terms of and ventral and anatomical terms of and ventral fins the forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water larvae often have a pair of balancers structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment some members of the genera ambystoma and dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form but this varies with species and with populations the northwestern salamander ambystoma gracile is one of these and depending on environmental factors either remains permanently in the larval state a condition known as neoteny or transforms into an adult both of these are able to breed neoteny occurs when the animals growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process the adult tiger salamander is terrestrial but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state when conditions are particularly inhospitable on land larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out there are fifteen species of wiktobligate neotenic salamanders including species of necturus olm and amphiuma and many examples of wiktfacultative ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances

lungless salamanders in the family plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander the female salamander often broods the eggs in the genus ensatinas the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion

in newts and salamanders metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs this is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems their lungs are functional early but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins the closure of gill slits thickening of the skin the development of eyelids and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land adult salamanders often have an aquatic phase in spring and summer and a land phase in winter for adaptation to a water phase prolactin is the required hormone and for adaptation to the land phase thyroxine external gills do not return in subsequent aquatic phases because these are completely absorbed upon leaving the water for the first time



most terrestrial caecilians that lay eggs do so in burrows or moist places on land near bodies of water the development of the young of ichthyophis glutinosus a species from sri lanka has been much studied the larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water they have three pairs of external red feathery gills a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes a lateral line system and a short tail with fins they swim by undulating their body from side to side they are mostly active at night soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land metamorphosis is gradual by the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes lateral line systems and tails the skin thickens embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments by this time the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land


in the majority of species of caecilians the young are produced by viviparity typhlonectes compressicauda a species from south america is typical of these up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time they are elongated and have paired gills small eyes and specialised scraping teeth at first they feed on the yolks of the eggs but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct this stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in lipids and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall they may increase their length sixfold and be as long as their mother before being born by this time they have undergone metamorphosis lost their eyes and gills developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles and reabsorbed their teeth a permanent set of teeth grow through soon after birth

the ringed caecilian siphonops annulatus has developed a unique adaptation for the purposes of reproduction the progeny feed on a skin layer that is specially developed by the adult in a phenomenon known as maternal dermatophagy the brood feed as a batch for about seven minutes at intervals of approximately three days which gives the skin an opportunity to regenerate meanwhile they have been observed to ingest fluid exuded from the maternal cloaca




the care of offspring among amphibians has been little studied but in general the larger the number of eggs in a batch the less likely it is that any degree of parental care takes place nevertheless it is estimated that in up to of amphibian species one or both adults play some role in the care of the young those species that breed in smaller water bodies or other specialised habitats tend to have complex patterns of behaviour in the care of their young

many woodland salamanders lay clutches of eggs under dead logs or stones on land the black mountain salamander desmognathus welteri does this the mother brooding the eggs and guarding them from predation as the embryos feed on the yolks of their eggs when fully developed they break their way out of the egg capsules and disperse as juvenile salamanders the male hellbender a primitive salamander excavates an underwater nest and encourages females to lay there the male then guards the site for the two or three months before the eggs hatch using body undulations to fan the eggs and increase their supply of oxygen


the male colostethus subpunctatus a tiny frog protects the egg cluster which is hidden under a stone or log when the eggs hatch the male transports the tadpoles on his back stuck there by a mucous secretion to a temporary pool where he dips himself into the water and the tadpoles drop off the male common midwife toad alytes obstetricans winds egg strings round his thighs and carries the eggs around for up to eight weeks he keeps them moist and when they are ready to hatch he visits a pond or ditch and releases the tadpoles the female frog rheobatrachus spp reared larvae in her stomach after swallowing either the eggs or however this stage was never observed before the species became extinct the tadpoles secrete a hormone that inhibits digestion in the mother whilst they develop by consuming their very large yolk supply the pouched frog assa darlingtoni lays eggs on the ground when they hatch the male carries the tadpoles around in brood pouches on his hind legs the aquatic surinam toad pipa pipa raises its young in pores on its back where they remain until metamorphosis the granular poison frog oophaga granulifera is typical of a number of tree frogs in the poison dart frog family dendrobatidae its eggs are laid on the forest floor and when they hatch the tadpoles are carried one by one on the back of an adult to a suitable crevice such as the wiktaxil of a leaf or the rosette botany of a bromeliaceae the female visits the nursery sites regularly and deposits unfertilised eggs in the water and these are consumed by the tadpoles



with a few exceptions adult amphibians are predation feeding on virtually anything that moves that they can swallow the diet mostly consists of small prey that do not move too fast such as beetles caterpillars earthworms and spiders the sirens siren often ingest aquatic plant material with the invertebrates on which they feed and a brazilian tree frog xenohyla truncata includes a large quantity of fruit in its diet the mexican burrowing toad rhinophrynus dorsalis has a specially adapted tongue for picking up ants and termites it projects it with the tip foremost whereas other frogs flick out the rear part first their tongues being hinged at the front

food is mostly selected by sight even in conditions of dim light movement of the prey triggers a feeding response frogs have been caught on fish hooks baited with red flannel and rana clamitans rana clamitans have been found with stomachs full of elm seeds that they had seen floating past toads salamanders and caecilians also use smell to detect prey this response is mostly secondary because salamanders have been observed to remain stationary near odoriferous prey but only feed if it moves amphibians normally hunt by smell some salamanders seem to have learned to recognize immobile prey when it has no smell even in complete darkness

amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew it lightly first to subdue it they typically have small hinged pedicellate teeth a feature unique to amphibians the base and crown of these are composed of dentine separated by an calcification layer and they are replaced at intervals salamanders caecilians and some frogs have one or two rows of teeth in both jaws but some frogs rana spp lack teeth in the lower jaw and toads bufo spp have no teeth in many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth


the tiger salamander ambystoma tigrinum is typical of the frogs and salamanders that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates others amphibians such as the bufo spp toads actively search for prey while the argentine horned frog ceratophrys ornata lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes among leaf litter frogs in panama frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim often brightly coloured and toxic while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and caecilians do not flick their tongues but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly teeth the struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow the subdued prey is gulped down whole

when they are newly hatched frog larvae feed on the yolk of the egg when this is exhausted some move on to feed on bacteria algal crusts detritus and raspings from submerged plants water is drawn in through their mouths which are usually at the bottom of their heads and passes through branchial food traps between their mouths and their gills where fine particles are trapped in mucus and filtered out others have specialised mouthparts consisting of a horny beak edged by several rows of labial teeth they scrape and bite food of many kinds as well as stirring up the bottom sediment filtering out larger particles with the papillae around their mouths some such as the spadefoot toads have strong biting jaws and are carnivorous or even cannibalistic

the calls made by caecilians and salamanders are limited to occasional soft squeaks grunts or hisses and have not been much studied a clicking sound sometimes produced by caecilians may be a means of orientation as in bats or a form of communication most salamanders are considered voiceless but the california giant salamander dicamptodon ensatus has vocal cords and can produce a rattling or barking sound some species of salamander emit a quiet squeak or yelp if attacked


frogs are much more vocal especially during the breeding season when they use their voices to attract mates the presence of a particular species in an area may be more easily discerned by its characteristic call than by a fleeting glimpse of the animal itself in most species the sound is produced by expelling air from the lungs over the vocal cords into an gular skin or sacs in the throat or at the corner of the mouth this may distend like a balloon and acts as a resonator helping to transfer the sound to the atmosphere or the water at times when the animal is submerged the main vocalisation is the males loud advertisement call which seeks to both encourage a female to approach and discourage other males from intruding on its territory this call is modified to a quieter courtship call on the approach of a female or to a more aggressive version if a male intruder draws near calling carries the risk of attracting predators and involves the expenditure of much energy other calls include those given by a female in response to the advertisement call and a release call given by a male or female during unwanted attempts at amplexus when a frog is attacked a distress or fright call is emitted often resembling a scream the usually nocturnal cuban tree frog osteopilus septentrionalis produces a rain call when there is rainfall during daylight hours


little is known of the territorial behaviour of caecilians but some frogs and salamanders defend home ranges these are usually feeding breeding or sheltering sites males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species females and even juveniles are also involved although in many frog species females are larger than males this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest arms or thumbs


in salamanders defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder this may involve snapping chasing and sometimes biting occasionally causing the loss of a tail the behaviour of red back salamanders plethodon cinereus has been much studied of marked individuals that were later recaptured were within a metre yard of their original daytime retreat under a log or rock a similar proportion when moved experimentally a distance of found their way back to their home base the salamanders left odour marks around their territories which averaged in size and were sometimes inhabited by a male and female pair these deterred the intrusion of others and delineated the boundaries between neighbouring areas much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals an aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively if the intruder persisted a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the grooves damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food

in frogs male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates in general a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires there is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders holders of territories have a home advantage and usually come off better in an encounter between two frogs if threats are insufficient chest to chest tussles may take place fighting methods include pushing and shoving deflating the opponents vocal sac seizing him by the head jumping on his back biting chasing splashing and ducking him under the water




amphibians have soft bodies with thin skins and lack claws defensive armour or spines nevertheless they have evolved various defence mechanisms to keep themselves alive the first line of defence in salamanders and frogs is the mucous secretion that they produce this keeps their skin moist and makes them slippery and difficult to grip the secretion is often sticky and distasteful or toxic snakes have been observed yawning and gaping when trying to swallow african clawed frogs xenopus laevis which gives the frogs an opportunity to escape caecilians have been little studied in this respect but the cayenne caecilian typhlonectes compressicauda produces toxic mucus that has killed predatory fish in a feeding experiment in brazil in some salamanders the skin is poisonous the newt taricha granulosa from north america and other members of its genus contain the neurotoxin tetrodotoxin ttx the most toxic substance known and almost identical to that produced by pufferfish handling the newts does not cause harm but ingestion of even the most minute amounts of the skin is deadly in feeding trials fish frogs reptiles birds and mammals were all found to be susceptible the only predators with some tolerance to the poison are certain populations of common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis
in locations where both snake and salamander the snakes have developed immunity through genetic changes and they feed on the amphibians with impunity coevolution occurs with the newt increasing its toxic capabilities at the same rate as the snake further develops its immunity some frogs and toads are toxic the main poison glands being at the side of the neck and under the warts on the back these regions are presented to the attacking animal and their secretions may be or cause various physical or neurological symptoms altogether over toxins have been isolated from the limited number of amphibian species that have been investigated




poisonous species often use bright colouring to warn potential predators of their toxicity these warning colours tend to be red or yellow combined with black with the fire salamander salamandra salamandra being an example once a predator has sampled one of these it is likely to remember the colouration next time it encounters a similar animal in some species such as the toad bombina spp the warning colouration is on the belly and these animals adopt a defensive pose when attacked exhibiting their bright colours to the predator the frog allobates zaparo is not poisonous but batesian mimicry the appearance of other toxic species in its locality a strategy that may deceive predators

many amphibians are nocturnal and hide during the day thereby avoiding diurnal predators that hunt by sight other amphibians use camouflage to avoid being detected they have various colourings such as mottled browns greys and olives to blend into the background some salamanders adopt defensive poses when faced by a potential predator such as the north american northern shrew blarina brevicauda their bodies writhe and they raise and lash their tails which makes it difficult for the predator to avoid contact with their granular glands a few salamanders will autotomise their tails when attacked sacrificing this part of their anatomy to enable them to escape the tail may have a constriction at its base to allow it to be easily detached the tail is regenerated later but the energy cost to the animal of replacing it is significant
some frogs and toads inflate themselves to make themselves look large and fierce and some spadefoot toads pelobates spp scream and leap towards the attacker giant salamanders of the genus andrias as well as ceratophryinae and pyxicephalus frogs possess sharp teeth and are capable of drawing blood with a defensive bite the blackbelly salamander desmognathus quadramaculatus can bite an attacking common garter snake thamnophis sirtalis two or three times its size on the head and often manages to escape


in amphibians there is evidence of habituation associative learning through both classical conditioning and instrumental learning and discrimination abilities

in one experiment when offered live fruit flies drosophila virilis salamanders chose the larger of vs and vs frogs can distinguish between low numbers vs vs but not vs and large numbers vs vs but not vs of prey this is irrespective of other characteristics ie surface area volume weight and movement although discrimination among large numbers may be based on surface area





dramatic declines in amphibian populations including population crashes and mass localized extinction have been noted since the late from locations all over the world and amphibian declines are thus perceived to be one of the most critical threats to global biodiversity in the international union for conservation of nature iucn reported stating that currently birds mammals and amphibians extinction rates were at minimum times greater than natural extinction times higher
in there were believed to be species of amphibians that depended on water at some stage during their life cycle of these were considered to be threatened and this figure is likely to be an underestimate because it excludes species for which there was insufficient data to assess their status a number of causes are believed to be involved including habitat destruction and modification pollution introduced species global warming chemical destruction of the ozone layer ultraviolet radiation has shown to be especially damaging to the skin eyes and eggs of amphibians and diseases like chytridiomycosis however many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood and are a topic of ongoing discussion


with their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins amphibians are often considered to be ecological indicators in many terrestrial ecosystems they constitute one of the largest parts of the vertebrate biomass any decline in amphibian numbers will affect the patterns of predation the loss of carnivorous species near the top of the food chain will upset the delicate ecosystem balance and may cause dramatic increases in opportunistic species in the middle east a growing appetite for eating frog legs and the consequent gathering of them for food was linked to an increase in henry a










a global strategy to stem the crisis was released in in the form of the amphibian conservation action plan developed by over eighty leading experts in the field this call to action details what would be required to curtail amphibian declines and extinctions over the following five years and how much this would cost the amphibian specialist group of the iucn is spearheading efforts to implement a comprehensive global strategy for amphibian conservation amphibian ark is an organization that was formed to implement the conservation recommendations of this plan and they have been working with zoos and aquaria around the world encouraging them to create assurance colonies of threatened amphibians one such project is the panama amphibian rescue and conservation project that built on existing conservation efforts in panama to create a response to the threat of chytridiomycosis

alaska is by far the list of us states and territories by area by area comprising more total area than the next three largest states texas california and montana combined and the list of country subdivisions by area it is the list of us states and territories by population and the list of us states and territories by population density state but by far the continents most populous territory located mostly north of the parallel north with an estimated population of as of than quadruple the combined populations of northern canada and greenland approximately half of alaskas residents live within the anchorage metropolitan area the state capital of juneau alaska is the of united states cities by area comprising more territory than the states of rhode island and delaware the former capital of alaska sitka alaska is the largest us city by area

alaska was occupied by various indigenous peoples for thousands of years before the arrival of europeans the state is considered the entry point for the settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge the russians were the first europeans to settle the area beginning in the century eventually establishing russian america which spanned most of the current state the expense and difficulty of maintaining this distant possession prompted alaska purchase in for or approximately two cents per acre the area went through several administrative changes before becoming organized as a territories of the united states on may it was admitted as the state of the us on january

while it has one of the smallest state economies in the country alaskas list of us states by gdp per capita owing to a diversified economy dominated by fishing natural gas and petroleum all of which it has in abundance united states armed forces bases and tourism in alaska are also a significant part of the economy of more than half the state is federally owned public land including a multitude of united states national forest parks and national wildlife refuge

the alaska natives of alaska is proportionally the highest of any us state at over percent close to two dozen native languages are spoken and alaskan natives exercise considerable influence in local and state politics



the name alaska was introduced in the russian america when it was used to refer to the alaska peninsula it was derived from an aleut language idiom which figuratively refers to the mainland literally it means object to which the action of the sea is directed at pp mainland alaska sea suffix object of its actionransom j ellis derivation of the word alaska american anthropologist ns pp





alaska is the northernmost and westernmost state in the united states and has the most easterly longitude in the united states because the aleutian islands extend into the eastern hemisphere alaska is the only united states us state on continental north about of british columbia canada separates alaska from washington state it is technically part of the continental united states but is sometimes not included in colloquial alaska is not part of the contiguous united states often called outside alaska the capital city juneau is situated on the mainland of the north american continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the north american highway system

the state is bordered by canadas yukon and british columbia to the east making it the only state to border a provinces and territories of canada the gulf of alaska and the pacific ocean to the south and southwest the bering sea bering strait and chukchi sea to the west and the arctic ocean to the north alaskas territorial waters touch russias territorial waters in the bering strait as the russian big diomede island and alaskan little diomede island are only apart alaska has a longer coastline than all the other us states combined




at in area alaska is by far the largest state in the united states and is more than twice the size of the us state texas alaska is the seventh list of the largest country subdivisions by area and if it was an independent nation would be the largest country in the world as it is larger than iran



there are no officially defined borders demarcating the various regions of alaska but there are six widely accepted regions





the most populous region of alaska containing anchorage the valley and the kenai peninsula rural mostly unpopulated areas south of the alaska range and west of the wrangell mountains also fall within the definition of south central as do the prince william sound area and the communities of cordova alaska and valdez alaska





also referred to as the panhandle or inside passage this is the region of alaska closest to the contiguous states as such this was where most of the initial settlement occurred in the years following the alaska purchase the region is dominated by the alexander archipelago as well as the tongass national forest the largest national forest in the united states it contains the state capital juneau the former capital sitka alaska and ketchikan at one time alaskas largest city the alaska marine highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area and country as only three communities haines alaska hyder alaska and skagway alaska enjoy direct connections to the contiguous north american road system






the interior is the largest region of much of it is uninhabited wilderness fairbanks alaska is the only large city in the region denali national park and preserve is located here denali formerly mount mckinley is the highest mountain in north america and is also located here






southwest alaska is a sparsely inhabited region stretching some inland from the bering sea most of the population lives along the coast kodiak island is also located in southwest the massive delta one of the largest river deltas in the world is here portions of the alaska peninsula are considered part of southwest with the remaining portions included with the aleutian islands see below





the north slope is mostly tundra peppered with small villages the area is known for its massive reserves of crude oil and contains both the national petroleum and the prudhoe bay oil field the city of alaska formerly known as barrow is the northernmost city in the united states and is located here the northwest arctic borough alaska anchored by kotzebue alaska and also containing the kobuk river valley is often regarded as being part of this region however the respective inupiat people of the north slope and of the northwest arctic seldom consider themselves to be one people





more than small volcanic islands make up this chain which stretches more than into the pacific ocean some of these islands fall in the eastern hemisphere but the international date line was drawn west of meridian to keep the whole state and thus the entire north american continent within the same legal day two of the islands attu island and kiska were occupied by japanese forces during world war ii






with its myriad islands alaska has nearly of tidal shoreline the aleutian islands chain extends west from the southern tip of the alaska peninsula many active volcanoes are found in the aleutians and in coastal regions unimak island for example is home to mount shishaldin which is an occasionally smoldering volcano that rises to above the north pacific it is the most perfect volcanic cone on earth even more symmetrical than japans mount fuji the chain of volcanoes extends to mount spurr west of anchorage on the mainland geologists have identified alaska as part of wrangellia a large region consisting of multiple states and canadian provinces in the pacific northwest which is actively undergoing plate tectonics

one of the worlds largest tides occurs in turnagain arm just south of anchorage where tidal differences can be more than



alaska has more than three million lakes marshlands and wetland permafrost cover mostly in northern western and southwest flatlands glacier ice covers about of alaska the bering glacier is the largest glacier in north america covering alone





according to an october report by the united states bureau of land management approximately of alaska is owned and managed by the federal government of the united states as public lands including a multitude of united states national forest national parks and national wildlife refuges of these the bureau of land management manages or of the state the arctic national wildlife refuge is managed by the united states fish and wildlife service it is the worlds largest wildlife refuge comprising

of the remaining land area the state of alaska owns its entitlement under the alaska statehood act a portion of that acreage is occasionally ceded to the organized boroughs presented above under the statutory provisions pertaining to newly formed boroughs smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other opportunities these are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations the university of alaska as a land grant university also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently

another are owned by regional and scores of local native corporations created under the alaska native claims settlement act ancsa of alaska native regional corporation doyon limited often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in alaska in advertisements and other communications provisions of ancsa allowing the corporations land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in were repealed before they could take effect effectively the corporations hold title including subsurface title in many cases a privilege denied to individual alaskans but cannot sell the land alaska native allotment act can be and are sold on the open market however

various private interests own the remaining land totaling about one percent of the state alaska is by a large margin the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when native corporation holdings are excluded







the climate in south and southeast alaska is a oceanic climate climate classification cfb and a subarctic oceanic climate cfc in the northern parts on an annual basis southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year juneau averages over of precipitation a year and ketchikan alaska averages over this is also the only region in alaska in which the average daytime high temperature is above freezing during the winter months

the climate of anchorage alaska and south central alaska is mild by alaskan standards due to the regions proximity to the seacoast while the area gets less rain than southeast alaska it gets more snow and days tend to be clearer on average anchorage alaska receives of precipitation a year with around of snow although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow it is a subarctic climate climate d climate due to its brief cool summers

the climate of southwest alaska is determined in large part by the bering sea and the gulf of alaska it is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north the temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is this region has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation an area stretching from the northern side of the seward peninsula to the kobuk river valley the region around kotzebue sound is technically a desert with portions receiving less than of precipitation annually on the other extreme some locations between dillingham alaska and bethel alaska average around of precipitation

the climate of the interior of alaska is subarctic some of the highest and lowest temperatures in alaska occur around the area near fairbanks alaska the summers may have temperatures reaching into the the while in the winter the temperature can fall below precipitation is sparse in the interior often less than a year but what precipitation falls in the winter tends to stay the entire winter

the highest and lowest recorded temperatures in alaska are both in the interior the highest is in fort yukon alaska which is just inside the arctic circle on june making alaska tied with hawaii as the state with the lowest high temperature in the united states the lowest official alaska temperature is in prospect creek alaska on january one degree above the lowest temperature recorded in continental north america in snag yukon

the climate in the extreme north of alaska is polar climate climate e polar climates with long very cold winters and short cool summers even in july the average low temperature in alaska is history for barrow alaska monthly summary for july weather underground weather service retrieved october precipitation is light in this part of alaska with many places averaging less than per year mostly as snow which stays on the ground almost the entire year




































numerous indigenous peoples occupied alaska for thousands of years before the arrival of european peoples to the area linguistic and dna studies done here have provided evidence for the settlement of north america by way of the bering land bridge at the upward sun river site in the tanana river valley in alaska remains of a infant were found the babys dna showed that she belonged to a population that was genetically separate from other native groups present elsewhere in the new world at the end of the pleistocene ben potter the university of alaska fairbanks archaeologist who unearthed the remains at the upward sun river site in named this new group ancient beringians the tlingit people developed a society with a matrilineal kinship system of property inheritance and descent in what is today southeast alaska along with parts of british columbia and the yukon also in southeast were the haida people now well known for their unique arts the tsimshian people came to alaska from british columbia in when president grover cleveland and later the us congress granted them permission to settle on annette island and found the town of metlakatla alaska all three of these peoples as well as other indigenous peoples of the pacific northwest coast experienced smallpox outbreaks from the late through the century with the most devastating epidemics occurring in the and resulting in high fatalities and social disruptionbrian c hosmer american indians in the marketplace persistence and innovation among the menominees and metlakatlans lawrence kansas university press of kansas pp

the aleutian islands are still home to the aleut peoples seafaring society although they were the first native alaskans to be exploited by the russians western and southwestern alaska are home to the yupik while their cousins the alutiiq people live in what is now southcentral alaska the gwichin people of the northern interior region are alaskan athabaskans and primarily known today for their dependence on the caribou within the arctic national wildlife refuge the north slope and little diomede island are occupied by the widespread inupiat people









some researchers believe the first russian settlement in alaska was established in the xvii no according to this hypothesis in several koch boat of semyon dezhnyovs expedition came ashore in alaska by storm and founded this settlement this hypothesis is based on the testimony of chukchi people geographer nikolai daurkin who had visited alaska in and who had reported on a village on the kheuveren river populated by bearded men who pray to the icons some modern researchers associate kheuveren with koyuk river

the first european vessel to reach alaska is generally held to be the st gabriel under the authority of the surveyor mikhail gvozdev and assistant navigator ivan fyodorov navigator on august during an expedition of siberian cossack a f shestakov and russian explorer dmitry pavlutsky another european contact with alaska occurred in when vitus bering led an second kamchatka expedition for the russian navy aboard the st peter after his crew returned to russia with sea otter pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of siberia toward the aleutian islands the first permanent european settlement was founded in

between and viceroyalty of new spain sent several spanish expeditions to the pacific northwest to assert its claim over the pacific northwest in a spanish settlement and fort san miguel were built in nootka sound these expeditions gave names to places such as valdez alaska bucareli sound and cordova alaska later the company carried out an expanded colonization program during the century sitka alaska renamed new archangel from to on baranof island in the alexander archipelago in what is now southeast alaska became the capital of russian america it remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the united states the russians never fully colonized alaska and the colony was never very profitable evidence of russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast alaska

william h seward the united states secretary of state negotiated the alaska purchase also known as sewards folly with the russians in for russias contemporary ruler tsar alexander ii of russia the emperor of the russian empire king of poland and grand duke of finland also planned the the man who alaska anchorage daily news the purchase was made on march six months later the commissioners arrived in sitka and the formal transfer was the formal took place at fort sitka on october in the ceremony uniformed us soldiers marched to the governors house at castle hill where the russian troops lowered the russian flag and the us flag was raised this event is celebrated as alaska day a legal holiday on october alaska was loosely governed by the military initially and was administered as a district of alaska starting in with a governor appointed by the president of the united states a federal united states territorial court was headquartered in sitka for most of alaskas first decade under the united states flag sitka was the only community inhabited by american settlers they organized a provisional city government which was alaskas first municipal government but not in a legal sense legislation allowing alaskan communities to legally incorporate as cities did not come about until and home rule in the united states for cities was extremely limited or unavailable until statehood took effect in





starting in the and stretching in some places to the early gold rushes in alaska and the nearby yukon brought thousands of miners and settlers to alaska alaska was officially incorporated as an organized territory in alaskas capital which had been in sitka alaska until was moved north to juneau alaska construction of the alaska governors mansion began that same year european immigrants from norway and sweden also settled in southeast alaska where they entered the fishing and logging industries


during world war ii the aleutian islands campaign focused on attu island agattu and kiska island all which were occupied by the empire of japanthese three aleutian outer islands are about away from mainland ussr from mainland alaska from japan during the japanese occupation a white american civilian and two united states navy personnel were killed at attu and kiska respectively and nearly a total of aleut civilians and eight sailors were interned in japan about half of the aleuts died during the period of internment harbor and adak alaska became significant bases for the united states army united states army air forces and united states navy the united states program involved flying american warplanes through canada to fairbanks and then soviet pilots took possession of these aircraft ferrying them to fight the german invasion of the soviet union the construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some alaskan cities





statehood for alaska was an important cause of james wickersham early in his tenure as a congressional delegate decades later the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in the alaska statehood committee and alaskas constitutional convention would soon follow statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes mostly in the us congress but also within alaska statehood was approved by congress on july alaska was officially proclaimed a state on january

in the census bureau reported alaskas population as white black and american indian and alaska native






on march the massive alaska earthquake killed people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities mainly by the resultant tsunamis and landslides it was the largest earthquakes by magnitude in recorded history with a moment magnitude scale of more than a thousand times as powerful as the loma prieta earthquake the time of day time of year spring and location of the epicenter were all cited as factors in potentially sparing thousands of lives particularly in anchorage


the discovery of oil at prudhoe bay and the completion of the pipeline system led to an oil boom royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from onward that same year not coincidentally alaska repealed its state income tax

in the exxon valdez hit a reef in the prince william sound exxon valdez oil spill more than of crude oil over of coastline today the battle between philosophies of development and conservation is seen in the contentious debate over oil drilling in the arctic national wildlife refuge and the proposed pebble mine

the gross state product was in the nation its list of us states by gdp per capita nominal for was ranking in the nation according to a study by phoenix marketing international alaska had the number of millionaires per capita in the united states with a ratio of percent the oil and gas industry dominates the alaskan economy with more than of the states revenues derived from petroleum extraction alaskas main export product excluding oil and natural gas is seafood primarily salmon cod pollock and crab

agriculture represents a very small fraction of the alaskan economy agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock dairy products vegetables and livestock manufacturing is limited with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere

employment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction shipping and transportation military bases are a significant component of the economy in the fairbanks north star anchorage and kodiak island boroughs as well as kodiak federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy allowing the state to keep taxes low its industrial outputs are crude petroleum natural gas coal gold precious metals zinc and other mining seafood processing timber and wood products there is also a growing service and tourism sector tourists have contributed to the economy by supporting local lodging






alaska has vast energy resources although its oil reserves have been largely depleted major oil and gas reserves were found in the alaska north slope ans and cook inlet basins but according to the energy information administration by february alaska had fallen to fourth place in the nation in crude oil production after texas north dakota and california prudhoe bay on alaskas north slope is still the second oil field in the united states typically producing about although by early north dakotas bakken formation was producing over prudhoe bay was the largest conventional oil field ever discovered in north america but was much smaller than canadas enormous athabasca oil sands field which by was producing about of unconventional oil and had hundreds of years of producible reserves at that rate

the pipeline can transport and pump up to of crude oil per day more than any other crude oil pipeline in the united states additionally substantial coal deposits are found in alaskas bituminous and lignite coal basins the united states geological survey estimates that there are of undiscovered technically recoverable gas from natural gas hydrates on the alaskan north slope alaska also offers some of the highest hydroelectric power potential in the country from its numerous rivers large swaths of the alaskan coastline offer wind and geothermal energy potential as well













alaskas economy depends heavily on increasingly expensive diesel fuel for heating transportation electric power and light although wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped proposals for statewide energy systems eg with special earth in interties were judged uneconomical at the time of the report due to low less than fuel prices long distances and low population the cost of a gallon of gas in urban alaska today is usually thirty to sixty cents higher than the national prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs seasonal usage peaks nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors



the alaska permanent fund is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues established by voters in to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed pipeline system the fund was originally proposed by governor keith harvey miller on the eve of the prudhoe bay lease sale out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale which amounted to at once it was later championed by governor jay hammond and kenai alaska alaska house of representatives hugh malone it has served as an attractive political prospect ever since diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund

the alaska constitution was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose the permanent fund has become the rare exception to this mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation from its initial principal of the fund has grown to as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside alaska this has led to frequent calls by alaskan politicians for the fund to make investments within alaska though such a stance has never gained momentum

starting in dividends from the funds annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible alaskans ranging from an initial in equal to three years payout as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme to in which included a resource rebate every year the state legislature takes out from the earnings puts back into the principal for inflation proofing and the remaining is distributed to all qualifying alaskans to qualify for the permanent fund dividend one must have lived in the state for a minimum of months maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment

the permanent fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a basic income policy in the world



the cost of goods in alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous states federal government employees particularly united states postal service usps workers and military members receive a cost of living allowance usually set at of base pay because while the cost of living has gone down it is still one of the highest in the country

rural alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure





due to the northern climate and short growing season relatively little farming occurs in alaska most farms are in either the matanuska valley about northeast of anchorage or on the kenai peninsula about southwest of anchorage the short growing season limits the crops that can be grown but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons the primary crops are potatoes carrots lettuce and cabbage

the tanana valley is another notable agricultural locus especially the delta junction alaska area about southeast of fairbanks with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic these farms mostly lie north and east of fort greely this area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by hammond during his second term as governor crops consist predominantly of barley and hay west of fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants the hotel and tourist industry and agriculture

alaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of market gardeners small farms and farmers markets in recent years with the highest percentage increase in the nation in growth in farmers markets in compared to nationwide the peony industry has also taken off as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world thereby filling a niche in the flower market













alaska with no counties lacks county fairs however a small assortment of state and local fairs with the alaska state fair in palmer alaska the largest are held mostly in the late summer the fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more commercial activities such as carnival rides concerts and food alaska grown is used as an agricultural slogan

alaska has an abundance of seafood with the primary fisheries in the bering sea and the north pacific seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it many alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence as well as sport this includes fish taken by hook net or wheel

hunting for subsistence primarily caribou moose and dall sheep is still common in the state particularly in remote the bush alaska communities an example of a traditional native food is akutaq the eskimo ice cream which can consist of reindeer fat seal oil dried fish meat and local berries

alaskas reindeer herding is concentrated on seward peninsula where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer

most food in alaska is transported into the state from outside alaska the other us states and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive in rural areas subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive although most small towns and villages in alaska lie along the coastline the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high because of the terrain and difficult road conditions which change dramatically due to varying climate and precipitation changes the cost of transport can reach as high as per pound or more in some remote areas during the most difficult times if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions the cost of delivering a of milk is about in many villages where per capita income can be or less fuel cost per gallon is routinely twenty to thirty cents higher than the contiguous united states average with only hawaii having higher prices













alaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the us the states road system covering a relatively small area of the state linking the central population centers and the alaska highway the principal route out of the state through canada the state capital juneau is not accessible by road only a car this has spurred debate over decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system or building a road connection from haines alaska the western part of alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of alaska


the interstate highways in alaska consists of a total of one unique feature of the alaska highway system is the anton anderson memorial tunnel an active alaska railroad tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of whittier alaska on prince william sound to the seward highway about southeast of anchorage at portage alaska at the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in north america until of the interstate tunnel as part of the big dig project in boston massachusetts the tunnel is the longest combination list of tunnels in north america






built around the alaska railroad arr played a key role in the development of alaska through the century it links north pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from seward alaska to interior alaska by way of south central alaska passing through anchorage eklutna wasilla talkeetna alaska denali and fairbanks with spurs to whittier alaska palmer alaska and north pole alaska the cities towns villages and region served by arr tracks are known statewide as the railbelt in recent years the paved highway system began to eclipse the railroads importance in alaskas economy

the railroad played a vital role in alaskas development moving freight into alaska while transporting natural resources southward such as coal from the usibelli coal mine near healy alaska to seward and gravel from the matanuska valley to anchorage it is well known for its summertime tour passenger service

the alaska railroad was one of the last railroads in north america to use cabooses in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains it continues to offer one of the last request stop routes in the country a stretch of about of track along an area north of talkeetna remains inaccessible by the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area until construction of the parks highway in the the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route

in northern southeast alaska the white pass and yukon route also partly runs through the state from skagway alaska northwards into canada british columbia and yukon territory crossing the border at white pass summit this line is now mainly used by tourists often arriving by cruise liner at skagway it was featured in the bbc television series great little railways

the alaska rail network is not connected to outside the nearest link to the north american railway network is the northwest terminus of the canadian national railway at prince rupert british columbia several hundred miles to the southeast in the us congress authorized to study the feasibility of a rail link between alaska canada and the lower

some private companies provides car float service between whittier alaska and seattle



many cities towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway the only modes of access involve travel by air river or the sea



alaskas ferry system known as the alaska marine highway serves the cities of southeast alaska the gulf coast and the alaska peninsula the ferries transport vehicles as well as passengers the system also operates a ferry service from bellingham washington and prince rupert british columbia in canada through the inside passage to skagway alaska the ferry authority also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the prince of wales island alaska region of southeast and works in concert with the alaska marine highway

in recent years cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market mainly connecting the pacific northwest to southeast alaska and to a lesser degree towns along alaskas gulf coast the population of ketchikan alaska for example fluctuates dramatically on many to four large cruise ships can dock there at the same time



cities not served by road sea or river can be reached only by air foot dogsled or snowmachine accounting for alaskas extremely well developed alaskan bush air alaskan novelty anchorage and to a lesser extent fairbanks is served by ted stevens anchorage international and destinations because of limited highway access air travel remains the most efficient form of transportation in and out of the state anchorage recently completed extensive remodeling and construction at ted stevens anchorage international airport to help accommodate the upsurge in tourism in alaska received almost two million visitors

regular flights to most villages and towns within the state that are commercially viable are challenging to provide so they are heavily subsidized by the federal government through the essential air service program alaska airlines is the only major airline offering travel with jet service sometimes in combination cargo and passenger boeing from anchorage and fairbanks international airport to regional hubs like bethel alaska nome alaska kotzebue alaska dillingham alaska kodiak alaska and other larger communities as well as to major southeast and alaska peninsula communities


the bulk of remaining commercial flight offerings come from small regional commuter airlines such as ravn alaska penair and frontier flying service the smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the cessna caravan the most popular aircraft in use in the state much of this service can be attributed to the alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to alaskan rural communities the program requires of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities

many communities have small air taxi services these operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas perhaps the most quintessentially alaskan plane is the bush seaplane the worlds busiest seaplane base is lake hood seaplane base located next to ted stevens anchorage international airport where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers cargo and many items from stores and warehouse clubs in alaska had the highest number of pilots per capita of any us state
out of the estimated residents were pilots or about one in federal aviation administration us civil airman statistics




another alaskan transportation method is the dogsled in modern times that is any time after the dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation various races are held around the state but the best known is the iditarod trail sled dog race a trail from anchorage to nome although the distance varies from year to year the official distance is set at the race commemorates the famous serum run to nome in which mushers and dogs like togo dog and balto took medicine to the community of nome alaska when all other means of transportation had failed mushers from all over the world come to anchorage each march to compete for cash prizes and prestige the serum run is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous relay leaving from the community of nenana alaska southwest of fairbanks to nome

in areas not served by road or rail primary transportation in summer is by vehicle and in winter by snowmobile or snow machine as it is commonly referred to in alaska



alaskas internet and other data transport systems are provided largely through the two major telecommunications companies gci company and alaska communications gci owns and operates what it calls the alaska united fiber optic system and as of late alaska communications advertised that it has two fiber optic paths to the lower and two more across alaska alaska communications coverage map alaska communications in january it was reported that a project to connect asia and rural alaska was being planned aided in part by in stimulus from the federal government









like all other us states alaska is governed as a republic with three separation of powers an executive branch consisting of the governor of alaska and his or her appointees which head executive a legislative branch consisting of the alaska house of representatives and alaska and a judicial branch consisting of the alaska supreme court and lower courts

alaskas court system has four levels the alaska supreme court the alaska court of appeals the superior courts and the district courts the superior and district courts are trial courts superior courts are courts of general jurisdiction while district courts hear only certain types of cases including misdemeanor criminal cases and civil cases valued up to

the supreme court and the court of appeals are appellate courts the court of appeals is required to hear appeals from certain decisions including those regarding criminal prosecutions juvenile delinquency and habeas corpus the supreme court hears civil appeals and may in its discretion hear criminal appeals












































































although in its early years of statehood alaska was a democratic party united states state since the early it has been characterized as republican party united local political communities have often worked on issues related to land use development fishing tourism and individual rights alaska natives while organized in and around their communities have been active within the alaska native regional corporations these have been given ownership over large tracts of land which require stewardship

alaska is not divided into county united states as most of the other us states but it is divided into list of boroughs and census areas in alaska many of the more densely populated parts of the state are part of alaskas boroughs which function somewhat similarly to counties in other states however unlike in the other states the boroughs do not cover the entire land area of the state the area not part of any borough is referred to as the unorganized borough alaska

the unorganized borough has no government of its own but the us census bureau in cooperation with the state divided the unorganized borough into census areas solely for the purposes of statistical analysis and presentation a recording district is a mechanism for management of the public record in alaska the state is divided into recording districts which are centrally administered under a state recorder of deeds all recording districts use the same acceptance criteria fee schedule etc for accepting documents into the public record

whereas many us states use a system of of alaska uses only two owing to the low population density most of the land is located in the unorganized borough as the name implies it has no intermediate borough government but is administered directly by the state government in of alaskas area has this status with of the population

anchorage merged the city government with the greater anchorage area borough in to form the municipality of anchorage containing the city proper and the communities of eagle river chugiak peters creek girdwood bird and indian fairbanks has a separate borough the fairbanks north star borough and municipality the city of fairbanks

agriculture is the science art and practice of cultivating plants and book and health in agriculture labour organization september july agriculture as all forms of activities connected with growing harvesting and primary processing of all types of crops with the breeding raising and caring for animals and with tending gardens and agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentism human civilization whereby farming of domestication species created food economic surplus that enabled people to live in cities the history of agriculture began thousands of years ago after gathering wild grains beginning at least years ago nascent farmers began to plant them around years ago pigs sheep and cattle were domesticated over years ago plants were independently cultivated in at least regions of the world industrial agriculture based on monoculture in the twentieth century came to dominate agricultural output though about people still depended on subsistence agriculture

modern agronomy plant breeding agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields while causing environmental impact of agriculture selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage environmental issues include contributions to global warming depletion of aquifers deforestation antibiotic resistance and growth hormones in industrial meat production agriculture is also very sensitive to environmental degradation such as biodiversity loss desertification soil degradation and climate change and agriculture which cause decrease in crop yieldunited nations environment programme making peace with nature a scientific blueprint to tackle the climate biodiversity and pollution emergencies nairobi genetically modified organisms are widely used although some are banned in certain countries

the major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods fibers fuels and raw materials such as natural rubber food classes include cereals grains vegetables fruits cooking oil meat milk edible mushroom and eggs as food over of the worlds workers are employed in agriculture second only to the service sector although in recent decades the global trend of a decreasing number of agricultural workers continues especially in developing countries where smallholding is being overtaken by industrial agriculture and mechanization creating global sustainable food systems which provides food security with sustainable agriculture practices is an international policy priority articulated in sustainable development goal nations resolution adopted by the general assembly on september





the word agriculture is a late middle english adaptation of latin from ager field and tillage or growing while agriculture usually refers to human activities certain species of attine ants termite and ambrosia beetle have been cultivating crops for up to million years agriculture is defined with varying scopes in its broadest sense using natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life including food fiber forest products horticultural crops and their related services thus defined it includes arable farming horticulture animal husbandry and forestry but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded

in the middle ages both arab agricultural revolution and in europe agriculture transformed with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants including the introduction of sugar rice cotton and fruit trees such as the orange to europe by way of book geographic journeys of a lifetime geographic society after the columbian exchange brought new world crops such as maize potatoes tomatoes sweet potatoes and manioc to europe and old world crops such as wheat barley rice and turnips and livestock including horses cattle sheep and goats to the americas

irrigation crop rotation and fertilizers advanced from the century with the british agricultural revolution allowing global population to rise significantly since agriculture in developed nations and to a lesser extent in the developing world has seen large rises in productivity as mechanized farming replaces human labor and assisted by synthetic fertilizers pesticides and selective breeding the method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining a further increase in global population modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological political and economic issues including water pollution biofuels genetically modified organisms tariffs and agricultural subsidy leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement





pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals in nomadic pastoralism herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture fodder and water this type of farming is practised in arid and regions of sahara central asia and some parts of india

in shifting cultivation a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees the cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil becomes too infertile and the area is abandoned another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated this type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly this practice is used in northeast india southeast asia and the amazon basin



subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone with little left over for transport elsewhere it is intensively practiced in monsoon asia and asia an estimated subsistence farmers worked in cultivating about of the earths arable land

intensive farming is cultivation to maximise productivity with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs water fertilizer pesticide and automation it is practiced mainly in developed countries






from the twentieth century intensive agriculture increased productivity it substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labor but caused increased water pollution and often involved farm subsidies in recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental awareness of conventional agriculture resulting in the organic farming regenerative agriculture and sustainable agriculture movements one of the major forces behind this movement has been the european union which first certified organic food in and began reform of its common agricultural policy cap in to phase out farm subsidies also known as decoupling and the growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management selective breeding and agriculture recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food gm science review first report prepared by the uk gm science review panel july chairman david king p demand for biofuel crops development of former farm lands rising transportation costs climate change and agriculture growing consumer demand in china and india and population growth are threatening food security in many parts of the worldwatts jonathan december riots and hunger feared as demand for grain sends food costs soaring the guardian londonmortished carl march already we have riots hoarding panic the sign of things to the times londonborger julian february feed the we are fighting a losing battle un admits the guardian london the international fund for agricultural development posits that an increase in smallholding may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security given the favorable experience of vietnam soil retrogression and degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns approximately of the worlds agricultural land is seriously degradedsample ian august global food crisis looms as climate change and population growth strip fertile land the guardian london by the agriculture in china was the largest in the world followed by the european union india and the united states economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture and by this measure agriculture in the united states is roughly times more productive than it was in




following the theory the number of people employed in agriculture and other primary sector activities such as fishing can be more than in the least developed countries and less than in the most highly developed countries since the industrial revolution many countries have made the transition to developed economies and the proportion of people working in agriculture has steadily fallen during the century in europe for example between and of the population was engaged in by the century this had dropped to between and in the same countries today the figure is less than
at the start of the century some one billion people or over of the available work force were employed in agriculture it constitutes approximately of the global employment of children and in many countries employs the largest percentage of women of any industry the service sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in





agriculture specifically farming remains a hazardous industry and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of injuries lung disease hearing loss skin diseases as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure on industrial agriculture injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is rollover protection structure pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects as an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself entire families can be at risk for injuries illness and death ages may be an especially vulnerable population in common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning machinery and motor accidents including with vehicles

the international labour organization considers agriculture one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors it estimates that the annual death toll among agricultural employees is at least twice the average rate of other jobs in addition incidences of death injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported the organization has developed the safety and health in agriculture convention which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play

in the united states agriculture has been identified by the national institute for occupational safety and health as a priority industry sector in the national occupational research agenda to identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues
in the european union the european agency for safety and health at work has issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in agriculture livestock farming horticulture and forestry the agricultural safety and health council of america ashca also holds a yearly summit to discuss safety

































































cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and geography and climate of the government economic social and political and the philosophy and culture of the farmeragricultural production systems pp in

shifting cultivation or slash and burn is a system in which forests are burnt releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial plant crops for a period of several yearsfarming systems development productivity and sustainability pp in then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest and the farmer moves to a new plot returning after many more years this fallow period is shortened if population density grows requiring the input of nutrients fertilizer or manure and some manual pest control annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period this requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs



further industrialization led to the use of monocultures when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage because of the low biodiversity nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers multiple cropping in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year and intercropping when several crops are grown at the same time are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures

in subtropics and arid environments the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year or requiring irrigation in all of these environments perennial crops are grown coffee chocolate and systems are practiced such as agroforestry in temperateness environments where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system

important categories of food crops include cereals legumes forage fruits and vegetables natural fibers include cotton wool hemp silk and flax specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world production is listed in millions of metric tons based on food and agriculture organization estimates

livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source as mixed and landless of earths and area was used for producing livestock with the sector employing approximately people between the and the there was a significant increase in livestock production both by numbers and by carcass weight especially among beef pigs and chickens the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of animals such as milk cows and chickens also showed significant production increases global cattle sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through aquaculture or fish farming the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production growing at an average of a year between and

during the second half of the century producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity this trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds



grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland rangeland and managed intensive rotational grazing for feeding ruminant animals outside nutrient inputs may be used however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source this system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil representing pastoralists mixed production systems use grassland fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric one mainly chickens and pigs livestock manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops

landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm representing the of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in organisation for economic and development member countries synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure use becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork scientists estimate that of the growth in livestock production between and will be in confined animal feeding operations sometimes called factory farming much of this growth is happening in developing countries in asia with much smaller amounts of growth in africa some of the practices used in commercial livestock production including the usage of growth hormones are controversial





tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or harrow tool to prepare for planting for nutrient incorporation or for pest control tillage varies in intensity from conventional to farming it may improve productivity by warming the soil incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds but also renders soil more prone to erosion triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organismsland preparation and farm energy pp in

pest control includes the management of weeds insects mites and diseases chemical pesticides biological biocontrol mechanical tillage and cultural practices are used cultural practices include crop rotation culling cover crops intercropping composting avoidance and disease resistance in fruit and vegetables integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss and recommends pesticides as a last resortpesticide use in us crop production pp in

nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production and the method of use of manure produced by livestock nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers manure green manure compost and mineralssoil and land pp in crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing such as in managed intensive rotational grazing or manure spreader either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pasturesnutrition from the soil pp in n weil r r practical nutrient management pp in elements of the nature and properties of soils pearson prentice hall upper saddle river nj



water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall in other areas such as the great plains in the us and canada farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture to use for growing a crop in the following yearplants and soil water pp in agriculture represents of freshwater use worldwide

according to a report by the international food policy research institute agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by the international food policy research institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as and food prices could be reduced by almost half

payment for ecosystem services is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city to improve the supply of fresh water







crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years since the beginning of civilization altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans for example larger fruits or seeds or resistance to pests significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist gregor mendel his work on dominant allele and recessive alleles although initially largely ignored for almost years gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits and and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism

domestication of plants has over the centuries increased yield improved disease resistance and drought tolerance eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants plant selection and breeding in the and improved pasture grasses and clover in new zealand extensive and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts ie primitive genetic engineering during the produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat corn maize and barley

the green revolution popularized the use of conventional hybrid biology to sharply increase yield by creating varieties for example average yields of corn maize in the us have increased from around tons per hectare bushels per acre in to about bushels per acre in similarly worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than in to more than in south american average wheat yields are around african under and egypt and arabia up to to with irrigation in contrast the average wheat yield in countries such as france is over variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate genetics and the level of intensive farming techniques use of fertilizers chemical pest control growth control to avoid lodgingconversion note bushel of lb bushel of

seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides including glyphosate these seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop crops are used by farmers worldwide with the increasing use of crops comes an increase in the use of herbicide sprays in some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed causing farmers to switch to other herbicides some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern with potential economic and health implications

other gmo crops used by growers include crops which have a gene from the soil bacterium bacillus thuringiensis bt which produces a toxin specific to insects these crops resist damage by insects some believe that similar or better traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or with wild species in some cases wild species are the primary source of resistance some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes







agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature especially herbicides and insecticides nutrient runoff excessive water usage and loss of natural environment a assessment of agriculture in the uk determined total external costs for of or per hectare a analysis of these costs in the us concluded that cropland imposes approximately to to per hectare while livestock production imposes both studies which focused solely on the fiscal impacts concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs neither included subsidies in their analysis but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society

agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens predators and competitors such as weeds costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units such as making fields this means removing hedges ditches and other areas of habitat pesticides kill insects plants and fungi these and other measures have cut biodiversity to very low levels on intensively farmed land

in the international resource panel of the united nations environment programme assessed the environmental impacts of consumption and production it found that agriculture and food consumption are two of the most important drivers of environmental pressures particularly habitat change climate change water use and toxic emissions agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment including insecticides especially those used on cotton the unep green economy report states that aagricultural operations excluding land use changes produce approximately per cent of anthropogenic global ghg emissions this includes ghgs emitted by the use of inorganic fertilizers pesticides and ghg emissions resulting from production of these inputs are included in industrial and fossil inputsunep towards a green economy pathways to sustainable development and poverty eradication on average we find that the total amount of fresh residues from agricultural and forestry production for generation biofuel production amounts to billion tonnes per year between and with an average annual growth rate of per cent throughout the period analysed accounting for higher growth during early years per cent for and an average per cent annual expansion after




a senior un official henning steinfeld said that livestock are one of the most significant contributors to todays most serious environmental problems livestock production occupies of all land used for agriculture or of the land surface of the planet it is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases responsible for of the worlds greenhouse gas emissions as measured in equivalents by comparison all transportation emits of the it produces of nitrous oxide which has times the global warming potential of and of all methane which is times as warming as it also generates of the ammonia emission livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving in the amazon basin of deforestation of the amazon rainforest is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feedcrops through deforestation and land degradation livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity furthermore the unep states that methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by per cent by under current practices and consumption patterns





land transformation the use of land to yield goods and services is the most substantial way humans alter the earths ecosystems and is considered the driving force in the biodiversity loss estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from to land degradation the decline in ecosystem function and productivity is estimated to be occurring on of land worldwide with cropland overrepresented the report cites land management as the driving factor behind degradation and reports that people rely upon the degrading land degradation can be deforestation desertification soil erosion mineral depletion or chemical degradation soil acidification and soil salinity

agriculture lead to rise in zoonotic disease like the coronavirus disease by degrading natural buffers between humans and animals reducing biodiversity and creating big groups of genetically similar animals

eutrophication excessive nutrients in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal bloom and anoxic waters leads to fish kills loss of biodiversity and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient mainly nitrogen and phosphorus surface runoff and leaching agriculture from agricultural land these nutrients are major nonpoint source pollution contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater with harmful effects on human populations fertilisers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light favouring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients
agriculture accounts for percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources agriculture is a major draw on water from aquifers and currently draws from those underground water sources at an unsustainable rate it is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern china the ganges and the western us are being depleted and new research extends these problems to aquifers in iran mexico and saudi arabia increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the worlds growing population with reduced water resources farm water usage can also cause major environmental problems including the destruction of natural wetlands the spread of diseases and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging when irrigation is performed incorrectly





pesticide use has increased since to short tons annually worldwide yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant the world health organization estimated in that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually causing deathsour planet our health report of the who commission on health and environment geneva world health organization pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticidestrategies for pest control pp in

an alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming a view exemplified by a quote heading the center for global food issues website growing more per acre leaves more land for nature however critics argue that a between the environment and a need for food is not inevitablelappe f collins rosset p myth food vs our environment pp in world hunger twelve myths grove press new york and that pesticides simply replace good agricultural practices such as crop rotation the agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping using plant aromas to repel pests from crops push and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed pull

current farming methods have resulted in water resources high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility there is not enough water to continue farming using current therefore how critical water land and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered a solution would be to give value to ecosystems recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights

technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable technology permits innovations like conservation tillage a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion reduces water pollution and enhances carbon sequestration other potential practices include conservation agriculture agroforestry improved convertible husbandry avoided grassland conversion and biochar current farming practices in the united states preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices such as crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy

according to a report by the international food policy research institute ifpri agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity food security and trade by ifpri found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as and food prices could be reduced by almost half the caloric demand of earths projected population with current climate change predictions can be satisfied by additional improvement of agricultural methods expansion of agricultural areas and a consumer mindset




since the agricultural productivity has increased dramatically due largely to the increased use of mechanization fertilizers and pesticides the vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources between the and the the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe with world grain production increasing significantly between and for wheat and to for rice depending on geographic area as world population doubled heavy reliance on petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output

industrialized agriculture depends on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways direct consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery


























indirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers pesticides and farm machinery in particular the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of agricultural energy usage together direct and indirect consumption by us farms accounts for about of the nations energy use direct and indirect energy consumption by us farms peaked in and has since gradually declined food systems encompass not just agriculture but processing packaging transporting marketing consumption and disposal of food and items agriculture accounts for less than of food system energy use in the us






agricultural economics is economics as it relates to the production distribution and consumption of agricultural goods and services combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late and grew significantly through the century although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the civil war southern united states to the european feudal system of book castles publishing group marilyn march november in the united states and elsewhere food costs attributed to food processing distribution and agricultural marketing sometimes referred to as the agricultural value chain have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined this is related to the greater efficiency of farming combined with the increased level of value added eg more highly processed products provided by the supply chain market concentration has increased in the sector as well and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers farmers and consumers and may have negative implications for rural communities

national government policies can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products in the form of taxation subsidy tariffs and other measures since at least the a combination of trade restrictions exchange rate policy and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world in the farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products between the and the early several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs subsidies and other trade restrictions

however there was still a significant amount of distortion in global agricultural product prices the three agricultural products with the greatest amount of trade distortion were sugar milk and rice mainly due to taxation among the oilseeds sesame had the greatest amount of taxation but overall feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products since the distortions have seen a greater decrease among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy despite this progress certain crops such as cotton still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices causing hardship in developing countries with farmers unprocessed commodities such as corn soybeans and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality affecting the price the producer receives commodities are generally reported by production quantities such as volume number or weight






agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact natural economic and social sciences used in the practice and understanding of agriculture it covers topics such as agronomy plant breeding and genetics plant pathology crop modelling soil science entomology production techniques and improvement study of pests and their management and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation waste management and bioremediation

the scientific study of agriculture began in the century when johann friedrich mayer agriculturist conducted experiments on the use of gypsum hydrated calcium sulphate as a fertilizerjohn armstrong jesse buel a treatise on agriculture the present condition of the art abroad and at home and the theory and practice of husbandry to which is added a dissertation on the kitchen and garden p research became more systematic when in john lawes and henry gilbert began a set of agronomy field experiments at rothamsted research station in some of them such as the park grass experiment are still running in america the hatch act of provided funding for what it was the first to call agricultural science driven by farmers interest in fertilizershillison j the origins of agriscience or where did all that scientific agriculture come journal of agricultural education in agricultural entomology the usda began to research biological control in it instituted its first large program in searching europe and japan for natural enemies of the lymantria dispar dispar and moth establishing parasitoids such as solitary wasps and predators of both pests in the usacoulson j vail p dix m nordlund d kauffman w eds years of biological control research and development in the united states department of agriculture us department of agriculture agricultural research service























agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment including policies related to climate change food safety and natural disasters economic stability including policies related to taxes natural resources and environmental sustainability especially water resource management research and development and market access for domestic commodities including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries agricultural policy can also touch on food quality ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality food security ensuring that the food supply meets the populations needs and conservation biology policy programs can range from financial programs such as subsidies to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs

there are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy including consumers agribusiness trade lobbies and other groups agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions political action groups including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions also provide influence as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities the food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements dr samuel jutzi director of faos animal production and health division states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment for example proposals in for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health and environmental regulations such as the number of animals an area of land can support without damage were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure

huxley was born in godalming surrey england in he was the third son of the writer and schoolmaster leonard huxley writer who edited cornhill magazine and his first wife julia arnold who founded priors field school julia was the niece of poet and critic matthew arnold and the sister of mary augusta ward julia named him aldous after a character in one of her sisters novelssutherland john mrs humphry ward eminent victorian edwardian clarendon press p aldous was the grandson of thomas henry huxley the zoology agnostic and controversialist darwins bulldog his brother julian huxley and andrew huxley also became outstanding biologists aldous had another brother noel trevenen huxley who took his own life after a period of major depressive disorderholmes charles mason aldous huxley and the way to reality greenwood press p

as a child huxleys nickname was ogie short for ogre he was described by his brother julian as someone who frequently contemplated the strangeness of things according to his cousin and contemporary gervas huxley he had an early interest in drawing

huxleys education began in his fathers botanical laboratory after which he enrolled at hillside school near godalming he was taught there by his own mother for several years until she became terminally ill after hillside he went on to eton college his mother died in when he was his leonard huxley later he contracted the eye disease keratitis punctata in this left him practically blind for two to three years this ended his early dreams of becoming a doctor in october huxley entered balliol college oxford where he studied english literature he volunteered for the british army in january for the world war however he was rejected on health grounds being in one eyeraychel haugrud reiff aldous huxley brave new world p marshall cavendish his eyesight later partly recovered he edited oxford poetry in and in june of that year graduated bachelor of arts with british undergraduate degree class honours his brother julian wrote



following his years at balliol huxley being financially indebted to his father decided to find employment he taught french for a year at eton college where eric blair who was to take the pen name george orwell and steven runciman were among his pupils he was mainly remembered as being an incompetent schoolmaster unable to keep order in class nevertheless blair and others spoke highly of his excellent command of language

huxley also worked for a time during the at tata chemicals europe an advanced chemical plant in billingham in county durham northeast england according to the introduction to the latest edition of his science fiction novel brave new world the experience he had there of an ordered universe in a world of planless incoherence was an important source for the novel



huxley completed his first unpublished novel at the age of and began writing seriously in his early twenties establishing himself as a successful writer and social satirist his first published novels were social satires crome yellow antic hay those barren leaves and point counter point brave new world was his fifth novel and first dystopian work in the he was also a contributor to vanity fair american magazine and vogue british magazine magazinesaldous huxley selected letters p ivan r dee



during the first world war huxley spent much of his time at garsington manor near oxford home of lady ottoline morrell working as a farm labourer there he met several bloomsbury group figures including bertrand russell alfred north whitehead and clive bell later in crome yellow he caricatured the garsington lifestyle jobs were very scarce but in john middleton murry was reorganising the athenaeum british magazine and invited huxley to join the staff he accepted immediately and quickly married the belgian refugee maria nys also at garsington they lived with their young son in italy part of the time during the where huxley would visit his friend d h lawrence following lawrences death in huxley edited lawrences letters

works of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress most famously brave new world and on pacifist themes for example eyeless in gaza in brave new world set in a dystopian london huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and classical conditioning huxley was strongly influenced by f matthias alexander and included him as a character in eyeless in gaza novel

beginning in this period huxley began to write and edit works on pacifist issues including ends and means an encyclopedia of pacifism and pacifism and philosophy and was an active member of the peace pledge union


in huxley moved to hollywood with his wife maria son matthew huxley and friend gerald heard he lived in the us mainly in southern california until his death and also for a time in taos new mexico where he wrote ends and means published in the book contains tracts on war religion nationalism and ethics

heard introduced huxley to vedanta upanishads meditation and vegetarianism through the principle of ahimsa in huxley befriended jiddu krishnamurti whose teachings he greatly admired huxley and krishnamurti entered into an enduring exchange sometimes edging on debate over many years with krishnamurti representing the more rarefied detached perspective and huxley with his pragmatic concerns the more socially and historically informed position huxley provided an introduction to krishnamurtis quintessential statement the first and last freedom roland star in the east pp sentient publications boulder co

huxley also became a vedantist in the circle of hindu swami prabhavananda and introduced christopher isherwood to this circle not long afterwards huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas the perennial philosophy which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world huxleys book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted five senses and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities

huxley became a close friend of remsen bird president of occidental college he spent much time at the college which is in the eagle rock los angeles neighbourhood of los angeles the college appears as tarzana college in his satirical novel after many a summer the novel won huxley a british literary award the james tait black memorial prize for fictionhaugrud reiff raychel aldous huxley brave new world p marshall cavendish huxley also incorporated bird into the novel

during this period huxley earned a substantial income as a hollywood christopher isherwood in his autobiography my guru and his disciple states that huxley earned more than per week approximately in inflation may in dollars as a screenwriter and that he used much of it to transport jewish and writer and artist refugees from hitlers germany to the us in march huxleys friend anita loos a novelist and screenwriter put him in touch with mgm which hired him for madame curie film which was originally to star greta garbo and be directed by george cukor eventually the film was completed by mgm in with a different director and cast huxley received screen credit for pride and prejudice film and was paid for his work on a number of other films including jane eyre film he was commissioned by walt disney in to write a script based on alices adventures in wonderland and the biography of the storys author lewis carroll the script was not used however

huxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of j d unwins book hopousia or the sexual and economic foundations of a new society

in huxley and maria applied for citizenship in the united states and presented themselves for examination when huxley refused to bear arms for the us and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals the only excuse allowed under the mccarran internal security act the judge had to adjourn the proceedings he withdrew his application nevertheless he remained in the us in huxley turned down an offer of a knight bachelor by the harold minister without putting forward a his brother julian had been knighted in while another brother andrew would be knighted in new britannica volume p

in the fall semester of huxley was invited by professor huston smith to be the carnegie visiting professor of humanities at the massachusetts institute of technology january roar smiths fifty years on the razors edge



biographer harold h watts wrote that huxleys writings in the final and extended period of his life are the work of a man who is meditating on the central problems of many modern men huxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself from these he made some warnings in his writings and talks in a televised interview conducted by journalist mike wallace huxley outlined several major concerns the difficulties and dangers of world the tendency towards distinctly hierarchical social the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as commodities in a december letter to brother julian summarizing a paper he had presented in santa barbara he wrote what i said was that if we didnt pretty quickly start thinking of human problems in ecological terms rather than in terms of power politics we should very soon be in a bad way

huxleys engagement with eastern wisdom traditions was entirely compatible with a strong appreciation of modern science biographer milton birnbaum wrote that huxley ended by embracing both science and eastern religion in his last book literature and science huxley wrote that the ethical and philosophical implications of modern science are more buddhist than christian in a philosophers visionary prediction published one month before he died huxley endorsed training in general semantics and the nonverbal world of culturally uncontaminated consciousness writing that we must learn how to be mentally silent we must cultivate the art of pure receptivity the individual must learn to decondition himself must be able to cut holes in the fence of verbalized symbols that hems him magazine philosophers visionary prediction


beginning in and continuing until his death in huxley had an extensive association with the vedanta society of southern california founded and headed by swami prabhavananda together with gerald heard christopher isherwood and other followers he was initiated by the swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices

in huxley wrote the introduction to the bhagavad gita the song of god translated by swami prabhavananda and christopher isherwood which was published by the vedanta society of southern california

from until huxley contributed articles to vedanta and the west published by the society he also served on the editorial board with isherwood heard and playwright john van druten from through

in the spring of huxley had his first experience with the psychedelic drug mescaline huxley had initiated a correspondence with doctor humphry osmond a british psychiatrist then employed in a canadian institution and eventually asked him to supply a dose of osmond obliged and supervised huxleys session in southern california after the publication of the doors of perception in which he recounted this experience huxley and swami prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience which may have caused the relationship to cool but huxley continued to write articles for the societys journal lecture at the temple and attend social functions huxley later had an the doors of experience that he considered more profound than those detailed in the doors of perception

huxley wrote that the mystical experience is doubly it is valuable because it gives the experiencer a better understanding of himself and the world and because it may help him to lead a less and more creative lifehuxley moksha aldous huxleys classic writings on psychedelics and the visionary experience



differing accounts exist about the details of the quality of huxleys eyesight at specific points in his life circa huxley encountered the bates method in which he was instructed by margaret darst corbett in huxley relocated from hollywood to a ranchito in the high desert hamlet of llano california in northern los angeles county huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the bates method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern american desert he reported that for the first time in more than years he was able to read without glasses and without strain he even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch he wrote a book about his experiences with the bates method the art of seeing which was published in us uk the book contained some generally disputed theories and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about huxleys eyesight

it was and is widely believed that huxley was nearly blind since huxley eye disease despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at oxford for example some ten years after publication of the art of seeing in bennett cerf was present when huxley spoke at a hollywood banquet wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty then suddenly he the disturbing truth became obvious he wasnt reading his address at all he had learned it by heart to refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes when it was only an inch or so away he still couldnt read it and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him it was an agonising momentcerf bennett april the saturday review column quoted in

brazilian author ubaldo ribeiro who as a young journalist spent several evenings in the huxleys company in the late wrote that huxley had said to him with a wry smile i can hardly see at all and i dont give a damn really

on the other hand huxleys second wife laura huxley later emphasised in her biographical account this timeless moment one of the great achievements of his life that of having regained his sight after revealing a letter she wrote to the los angeles times disclaiming the label of huxley as a poor fellow who can hardly see by walter c alvarez she tempered her statement with although i feel it was an injustice to treat aldous as though he were blind it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision for instance although aldous did not wear glasses he would quite often use a magnifying lens laura huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to huxleys vision her account in this respect agrees with the following sample of huxleys own words from the art of seeing the most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism or any part of the organism is that it is not constant but highly variable nevertheless the topic of huxleys eyesight continues to endure similar significant controversyrolfe lionel literary la p chronicle books university of california

no definition of algae is generally accepted one definition is that algae have chlorophyll as their primary photosynthetic pigment and lack a sterile covering of cells around their reproductive cells likewise the colorless prototheca under chlorophyta are all devoid of any chlorophyll although cyanobacteria are often referred to as algae most authorities exclude all prokaryotes from the definition of algae algae constitute a polyphyletic group since they do not include a common ancestor and although their plastids seem to have a single origin from cyanobacteria they were acquired in different ways green algae are examples of algae that have primary chloroplasts derived from endosymbiotic theory cyanobacteria diatoms and brown algae are examples of algae with secondary chloroplasts derived from an endosymbiotic endosymbiosis red algaalgae exhibit a wide range of reproductive strategies from simple asexual reproduction cell division to complex forms of sexual reproductionsmithsonian national museum of natural department of botany

algae lack the various structures that characterize land plants such as the phyllids structures of bryophytes rhizoids in nonvascular plants and the roots leaf and other organ anatomy found in tracheophytes vascular plants most are phototrophic although some are mixotrophic deriving energy both from photosynthesis and uptake of organic carbon either by osmotrophy myzocytosis or phagocytosis some unicellular species of green algae many golden algae euglenids dinoflagellates and other algae have become heterotrophs also called colorless or apochlorotic algae sometimes parasitic relying entirely on external energy sources and have limited or no photosynthetic apparatuspringsheim e g farblose algen ein beitrag zur evolutionsforschung gustav fischer verlag stuttgart pp some other heterotrophic organisms such as the apicomplexans are also derived from cells whose ancestors possessed plastids but are not traditionally considered as algae algae have photosynthetic machinery ultimately derived from cyanobacteria that produce oxygen as a of photosynthesis unlike other photosynthetic bacteria such as purple sulfur bacteria and green sulfur bacteria fossilized filamentous algae from the vindhya basin have been dated back to to years ago

because of the wide range of types of algae they have increasing different industrial and traditional applications in human society traditional seaweed farming practices have existed for of years and have strong traditions in east asia food cultures more modern algaculture applications extend the edible seaweed for other applications include cattle feed using algae for bioremediation or pollution control transforming sunlight into algae fuel or other chemicals used in industrial processes and in medical and scientific applications a review found that these applications of algae could play an important role in carbon sequestration in order to climate change mitigation while providing valuable products for global economies


the singular is the latin word for seaweed and retains that meaning in english the etymology is obscure although some speculate that it is related to latin be cold no reason is known to associate seaweed with temperature a more likely source is binding entwining

the ancient greek word for seaweed was which could mean either the seaweed probably red algae or a red dye derived from it the latinization meant primarily the cosmetic rouge the etymology is uncertain but a strong candidate has long been some word related to the biblical paint if not that word itself a cosmetic used by the ancient egyptians and other inhabitants of the eastern mediterranean it could be any color black red green or blue

accordingly the modern study of marine and freshwater algae is called either phycology or algology depending on whether the greek or latin root is used the name fucus appears in a number of taxon






the primary classification of algae is based on certain morphological features the chief among these are a pigment constitution of the cell b chemical nature of stored food materials c kind number point of insertion and relative length of the flagella on the motile cell d chemical composition of cell wall and e presence or absence of a definitely organized nucleus in the cell or any other significant details of cell structure



although carolus linnaeus included algae along with lichens in his class cryptogamia he did not elaborate further on the classification of algae

jean pierre vaucher was perhaps the first to propose a system of classification of algae and he recognized three groups conferves ulves and tremelles while johann heinrich friedrich link classified algae on the basis of the colour of the pigment and structure william henry harvey proposed a system of classification on the basis of the habitat and the pigment j g agardh divided algae into six orders diatomaceae nostochineae confervoideae ulvaceae floriadeae and fucoideae around algae along with fungi were grouped under thallophyta a division created by eichler encouraged by this adolf engler and karl anton eugen prantl proposed a revised scheme of classification of algae and included fungi in algae as they were of opinion that fungi have been derived from algae the scheme proposed by engler and prantl is summarised as follows














the algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria chloroplasts contain circular dna like that in cyanobacteria and are interpreted as representing reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria however the exact origin of the chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae reflecting their acquisition during different endosymbiotic events the table below describes the composition of the three major groups of algae their lineage relationships are shown in the figure in the upper right many of these groups contain some members that are no longer photosynthetic some retain plastids but not chloroplasts while others have lost plastids entirely





































these groups have green chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and b their chloroplasts are surrounded by four and three membranes respectively and were probably retained from ingested green algae

chlorarachniophytes which belong to the phylum cercozoa contain a small nucleomorph which is a relict of the algaes cell nucleus

euglenids which belong to the phylum euglenozoa live primarily in fresh water and have chloroplasts with only three membranes the endosymbiotic green algae may have been acquired through myzocytosis rather than phagocytosis









these groups have chloroplasts containing chlorophylls a and c and phycobilins the shape varies from plant to they may be of discoid reticulate spiral or ribbon shaped they have one or more pyrenoids to preserve protein and starch the latter chlorophyll type is not known from any prokaryotes or primary chloroplasts but genetic similarities with red algae suggest a relationship there

in the first three of these groups chromista the chloroplast has four membranes retaining a nucleomorph in cryptomonads and they likely share a common pigmented ancestor although other evidence casts doubt on whether the heterokonts haptophyta and cryptomonads are in fact more closely related to each other than to other groups

the typical dinoflagellate chloroplast has three membranes but considerable diversity exists in chloroplasts within the group and a number of endosymbiotic events apparently occurred the apicomplexa a group of closely related parasites also have plastids called apicoplasts which are not photosynthetic but appear to have a common origin with dinoflagellate chloroplasts




carl linnaeus in species plantarum the starting point for modern botanical nomenclature recognized genera of algae of which only four are currently considered among algae in edition of systema naturae linnaeus described the genera volvox and corallina and a species of acetabularia as madrepora among the animals

in samuel gottlieb gmelin published the historia fucorum the first work dedicated to marine algae and the first book on marine biology to use the then new binomial nomenclature of linnaeus it included elaborate illustrations of seaweed and marine algae on folded leaves

william henry harvey and lamouroux were the first to divide macroscopic algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation this is the first use of a biochemical criterion in plant systematics harveys four divisions are red algae rhodospermae brown algae melanospermae green algae chlorospermae and diatomaceae

at this time microscopic algae were discovered and reported by a different group of workers eg otto friedrich and christian gottfried ehrenberg studying the infusoria microscopic organisms unlike macroalgae which were clearly viewed as plants microalgae were frequently considered animals because they are often motile even the nonmotile coccoid microalgae were sometimes merely seen as stages of the lifecycle of plants macroalgae or animalsbraun a algarum unicellularium genera nova et minus cognita praemissis observationibus de algis unicellularibus in genere new and less known genera of unicellular algae preceded by observations respecting unicellular algae in general lipsiae apud w engelmann translation at lankester e busk g eds quarterly journal of microscopical science vol siebold c th v ueber einzellige pflanzen und thiere on unicellular plants and animals in siebold c th v a zeitschrift wissenschaftliche zoologie bd p translation at lankester e busk g eds quarterly journal of microscopical science vol

although used as a taxonomic category in some classifications eg linnaeus de jussieu horaninow agassiz wilson cassin in further classifications the algae are seen as an artificial polyphyletic group

throughout the century most classifications treated the following groups as divisions or classes of algae cyanophytes rhodophytes chrysophytes xanthophytes diatom phaeophytes cryptomonad and dinophytes euglenophytes and chlorophytes later many new groups were discovered eg bolidophyceae and others were splintered from older groups charophytes and glaucophytes from chlorophytes many heterokontophytes eg synurophyceae from chrysophytes or eustigmatophytes from xanthophytes haptophytes from chrysophytes and chlorarachniophytes from xanthophytes

with the abandonment of dichotomous classification most groups of algae sometimes all were included in protista later also abandoned in favour of eukaryota however as a legacy of the older plant life scheme some groups that were also treated as protozoans in the past still have duplicated classifications see ambiregnal protists

some parasitic algae eg the green algae prototheca and helicosporidium parasites of metazoans or cephaleuros parasites of plants were originally classified as fungi sporozoans or protistans of incertae sedis while others eg the green algae phyllosiphon and rhodochytrium parasites of plants or the red algae pterocladiophila and gelidiocolax mammillatus parasites of other red algae or the dinoflagellates oodinium parasites of fish had their relationship with algae conjectured early in other cases some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae eg chlorochytrium but later were seen as endophytic algaeround some filamentous bacteria eg beggiatoa were originally seen as algae furthermore groups like the apicomplexans are also parasites derived from ancestors that possessed plastids but are not included in any group traditionally seen as algae


the first land plants probably evolved from shallow freshwater charophyte algae much like chara alga almost years ago these probably had an isomorphic alternation of generations and were probably filamentous fossils of isolated land plant spores suggest land plants may have been around as long as years ago




a range of algal morphology biology is exhibited and convergent evolution of features in unrelated groups is common the only groups to exhibit multicellular thallus are the red algae and brown algae and some chlorophyta apical growth is constrained to subsets of these groups the florideophyceae reds various browns and the charophytes the form of charophytes is quite different from those of reds and browns because they have distinct nodes separated by internode whorls of branches reminiscent of the horsetails occur at the nodes conceptacles are another polyphyletic they appear in the coralline algae and the hildenbrandiales as well as the browns

most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids but colonial and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups some of the more common organizational levels more than one of which may occur in the biological life cycle of a species are







in three lines even higher levels of organization have been reached with full tissue differentiation these are the brown of which may reach in length red algae and the green algae the most complex forms are found among the charophyte algae see charales and charophyta in a lineage that eventually led to the higher land plants the innovation that defines these nonalgal plants is the presence of female reproductive organs with protective cell layers that protect the zygote and developing embryo hence the land plants are referred to as the embryophytes


the term algal turf is commonly used but poorly defined algal turfs are thick beds of seaweed that retain sediment and compete with foundation species like coral reef and kelp and they are usually less than tall such a turf may consist of one or more species and will generally cover an area in the order of a square metre or more some common characteristics are listed









many algae particularly members of the characeae species have served as model experimental organisms to understand the mechanisms of the water permeability of membranes osmoregulation turgor regulation salt tolerance cytoplasmic streaming and the generation of action potentials

phytohormones are found not only in higher plants but in algae too


some species of algae form symbiosis with other organisms in these symbioses the algae supply photosynthates organic substances to the host organism providing protection to the algal cells the host organism derives some or all of its energy requirements from the algae examples are




lichens are defined by the international association for lichenology to be an association of a fungus and a photosynthetic symbiont resulting in a stable vegetative body having a specific structure the fungi or mycobionts are mainly from the ascomycota with a few from the basidiomycota in nature they do not occur separate from lichens it is unknown when they began to associate one mycobiont associates with the same phycobiont species rarely two from the green algae except that alternatively the mycobiont may associate with a species of cyanobacteria hence photobiont is the more accurate term a photobiont may be associated with many different mycobionts or may live accordingly lichens are named and classified as fungal speciesbrodo et al p a species of lichen collected anywhere in its range has the same fungus and generally the same photobiont a particular photobiont though may associate with scores of different lichen fungi the association is termed a morphogenesis because the lichen has a form and capabilities not possessed by the symbiont species alone they can be experimentally isolated the photobiont possibly triggers otherwise latent genes in the mycobiontbrodo et al p

trentepohlia alga is an example of a common green alga genus worldwide that can grow on its own or be lichenised lichen thus share some of the habitat and often similar appearance with specialized species of algae aerophytes growing on exposed surfaces such as tree trunks and rocks and sometimes discoloring them







endosymbiontic green algae live close to the surface of some sponges for example breadcrumb sponges halichondria panicea the alga is thus protected from the sponge is provided with oxygen and sugars which can account for to of sponge growth in some species


rhodophyta chlorophyta and heterokontophyta the three main algal phylum have lifecycles which show considerable variation and complexity in general an asexual phase exists where the seaweeds cells are diploid a sexual phase where the cells are haploid followed by fusion of the male and female gametes asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases but less variation is possible commonly in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae two specialized sexually compatible haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a zygote to ensure a successful mating the development and release of gametes is highly synchronized and pheromones may play a key role in these processes sexual reproduction allows for more variation and provides the benefit of efficient recombinational repair of dna damages during meiosis a key stage of the sexual cycle however sexual reproduction is more costly than asexual reproduction meiosis has been shown to occur in many different species of algae





the algal collection of the us national herbarium located in the national museum of natural history consists of approximately dried specimens which although not exhaustive no exhaustive collection exists gives an idea of the order of magnitude of the number of algal species that number remains unknown estimates vary widely for example according to one standard textbookjohn p in the british isles the uk biodiversity steering group report estimated there to be algal species in the uk another checklist reports only about species regarding the difference of about species the text concludes it will require many detailed field surveys before it is possible to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of







and so on but lacking any scientific basis or reliable sources these numbers have no more credibility than the british ones mentioned above most estimates also omit microscopic algae such as phytoplankton




the distribution of algal species has been fairly well studied since the founding of phytogeography in the century algae spread mainly by the dispersal of spores analogously to the dispersal of plantae by seeds and spores this dispersal can be accomplished by air water or other organisms due to this spores can be found in a variety of environments fresh and marine waters air soil and in or on other organisms whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands

the spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind as well as by living carriers however not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them marine spores are often spread by ocean currents ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability resulting in phytogeographic zones regions and provincesround p

to some degree the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features such as antarctica long distances of ocean or general land masses it is therefore possible to identify species occurring by locality such as pacific algae or north sea algae when they occur out of their localities hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible such as the hulls of ships for example ulva reticulata and u fasciata travelled from the mainland to hawaii in this manner

mapping is possible for select species only there are many valid examples of confined distribution patternsround p for example clathromorphum is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of thereround p however scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the difficulties of undertaking such studiesround p



algae are prominent in bodies of water common in terrestrial environments and are found in unusual environments such as on snow algae and ice algae seaweeds grow mostly in shallow marine waters under however some such as navicula pennata have been recorded to a depth of round p a type of algae ancylonema nordenskioeldii was found in greenland in areas known as the dark zone which caused an increase in the rate of melting ice sheet same algae was found in the italian alps after pink ice appeared on parts of the presena glacier

the various sorts of algae play significant roles in aquatic ecology microscopic forms that live suspended in the water column phytoplankton provide the food base for most marine food chains in very high densities algal blooms these algae may discolor the water and outcompete poison or asphyxiate other life forms

algae can be used as indicator organisms to monitor pollution in various aquatic systems in many cases algal metabolism is sensitive to various pollutants due to this the species composition of algal populations may shift in the presence of chemical pollutants to detect these changes algae can be sampled from the environment and maintained in laboratories with relative ease

on the basis of their habitat algae can be categorized as aquatic plant planktonic benthic marine biology freshwater lentic loticnecchi jr o ed river algae springer terrestrial plant aerobiology subaerial lithophytic halophytic or euryhaline psammon thermophilic psychrophile epibiont epiphytic epizoic endosymbiont endophytic endozoic parasitic calcareous or lichenic phycobiontsharma o p

analysis of variance anova is a collection of statistical models and their associated estimation procedures such as the variation among and between groups used to analyze the differences among means anova was developed by the statistician ronald fisher anova is based on the law of total variance where the observed variance in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation in its simplest form anova provides a statistical test of whether two or more population means are equal and therefore generalizes the students beyond two means



while the analysis of variance reached fruition in the century antecedents extend centuries into the past according to stiglerstigler these include hypothesis testing the partitioning of sums of squares experimental techniques and the additive model laplace was performing hypothesis testing in the p around laplace and carl friedrich gauss developed the method for combining observations which improved upon methods then used in astronomy and geodesy it also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares laplace knew how to estimate a variance from a residual rather than a total sum of squaresstigler p by laplace was using least squares methods to address anova problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tidesstigler before astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting
from reaction times the personal equation and had developed methods of reducing the errorsstigler the experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology stigler
chapter psychophysics as a which developed strong full factorial experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon addedstigler p an eloquent explanation of the additive effects model was


ronald fisher introduced the term variance and proposed its formal analysis in a article the correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritancethe correlation between relatives on the supposition of mendelian inheritance ronald a fisher philosophical transactions of the royal society of edinburgh volume pages his first application of the analysis of variance was published in the probable error of a coefficient of correlation deduced from a small sample ronald a fisher metron analysis of variance became widely known after being included in fishers book statistical methods for research workers

randomization models were developed by several researchers the first was published in polish by jerzy neyman in p randomization models were first formulated by neyman for the completely randomized design by neyman for randomized blocks by welch and pitman for the latin square under a certain null hypothesis and by kempthorne and wilk for many other



in the illustrations to the right groups are identified as etc in the first illustration the dogs are divided according to the product interaction of two binary groupings young vs old and vs eg group is young dogs group is young dogs etc since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups shown in blue has a relatively large variance and since the means are very similar across groups grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights knowing which group a dog is in doesnt allow us to predict its weight much better than simply knowing the dog is in a dog show thus this grouping fails to explain the variation in the overall distribution

an attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as pet vs working breed and less athletic vs more athletic would probably be somewhat more successful fair fit the heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter as shown by the second illustration the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case and the means are more distinguishable however the significant overlap of distributions for example means that we cannot distinguish and reliably grouping dogs according to a coin flip might produce distributions that look similar

an attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit all chihuahuas are light and all st bernards are heavy the difference in weights between setters and pointers does not justify separate breeds the analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments a common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models the method has some advantages over correlation not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship


anova is a form of statistical hypothesis testing heavily used in the analysis of experimental data a test result calculated from the null hypothesis and the sample is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance assuming the truth of the null hypothesis a statistically significant result when a probability is less than a threshold significance level justifies the rejection of the null hypothesis but only if the a priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high

in the typical application of anova the null hypothesis is that all groups are random samples from the same population for example when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the same effect perhaps none rejecting the null hypothesis is taken to mean that the differences in observed effects between treatment groups are unlikely to be due to random chance

by construction hypothesis testing limits the rate of type i errors false positives to a significance level experimenters also wish to limit type ii errors false negatives
the rate of type ii errors depends largely on sample size the rate is larger for smaller samples significance
level the standard of proof is high the chances of overlooking
a discovery are also and effect size a smaller effect size is more prone to type ii error



measures responses in an attempt to determine an effect factors are
assigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and
randomized block design to ensure the validity of the results blind experiment keeps the

the result of the effect and is partially random error

anova is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple
purposes as a consequence it is difficult to define concisely or precisely

classical anova for balanced data does three things at once






anova has long enjoyed the status of being the most used would



anova is difficult to teach particularly for complex experiments with restricted randomization being notoriousgelman p in some cases the proper
application of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognition




there are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance and these are outlined here



the model class i of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the response variable values change this allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole



model class ii is used when the treatments are not fixed this occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population because the levels themselves are random variables some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments a generalization of simple differences differ from the modelmontgomery chapter experiments with random factors



a model class iii contains experimental factors of both fixed and types with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types


teaching experiments could be performed by a college or university department
to find a good introductory textbook with each text considered a


differences exist among a list of randomly selected texts the



defining fixed and random effects has proven elusive with competing




the analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches the most common of which uses a linear model that relates the response to the treatments and blocks note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data


the analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a linear model which makes the following assumptions about the probability distribution of the book statistical methods















the separate assumptions of the textbook model imply that the errors and residuals in statistics are independently identically and normally distributed for fixed effects models that is that the errors are independent and





in a randomized controlled trial the treatments are randomly assigned to experimental units following the experimental protocol this randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out the objective is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis following the ideas of charles sanders peirce and ronald fisher this analysis was discussed and developed by francis j anscombe at rothamsted experimental station and by oscar kempthorne at iowa state universityanscombe kempthorne and his students make an assumption of unit treatment additivity which is discussed in the books of kempthorne and david r cox


in its simplest form the assumption of additivity is simply termed additivity in most texts hinkelmann and kempthorne add adjectives and distinguish between additivity in the strict and broad senses this allows a detailed consideration of multiple error sources treatment state selection measurement and sampling on page states that the observed response from experimental unit i when receiving treatment j can be written as the sum of the units response and the that is kempthorne p chapter some key assumptionshinkelmann and kempthorne volume throughout introduced in section principles of experimental the linear outline of a model

the assumption of additivity implies that for every treatment j the jth treatment has exactly the same effect on every experiment unit

the assumption of unit treatment additivity usually cannot be directly falsificationism according to cox and kempthorne however many consequences of additivity can be falsified for a randomized experiment the assumption of additivity implies that the variance is constant for all treatments therefore by contraposition a necessary condition for additivity is that the variance is constant

the use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the inference that is standard in survey sampling


kempthorne uses the and the assumption of unit treatment additivity to produce a derived linear model very similar to the textbook model discussed previouslyhinkelmann and kempthorne volume section
completely randomized derived linear the test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model according to approximation theorems and simulation studieshinkelmann and kempthorne volume section completely randomized approximating the randomization test however there are differences for example the analysis results in a small but strictly negative correlation between the observationsbailey chapter a more general model in bailey and kempthorne volume chapter comparison of treatments in the analysis there is no assumption of a normal distribution and certainly no assumption of independence on the contrary the observations are

the analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time since the analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach few statisticians object to analysis of balanced randomized experiments


however when applied to data from experiments or observational study analysis lacks the warrant of randomization

the experimenter must decide which of the various causes that he
feels will produce variations in his results must be controlled

because he is not cognizant of them he must control by the device of

applied by the experimenter using the full randomization procedure is
the chain of inductive inference sound it is only under these

observes to the treatment and the treatment only under these

for observational data the derivation of confidence intervals must use subjective models as emphasized by ronald fisher and his followers in practice the estimates of from observational studies generally are often inconsistent in practice statistical models and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the publicfreedman







both these analyses require homoscedasticity as an assumption for the analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the analysis





no necessary assumptions for anova in its full generality but the



problems which do not satisfy the assumptions of anova can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions
the property of additivity is not invariant under a change of scale so statisticians often use transformations to achieve additivity if the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions then the statistician may specify in the protocol for the experiment or observational study that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variancehinkelmann and kempthorne volume section completely randomized transformations also a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses which are believed to follow a multiplicative modelbailey
according to cauchys functional equation theorem the logarithm is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition


anova is used in the analysis of comparative experiments those in
which only the difference in outcomes is of interest the statistical
significance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two



observations by a constant does not alter significance so anova

scaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations
in the era of mechanical calculation it was common to




cochran cox p example this is an example of data



the calculations of anova can be characterized as computing a number
of means and variances dividing two variances and comparing the ratio

a treatment effect is then trivial the effect of any treatment is
estimated by taking the difference between the mean of the








divisor is called the degrees of freedom df the summation is called
the sum of squares ss the result is called the mean square ms and
the squared terms are deviations from the sample mean anova
estimates sample variances a total variance based on all the
observation deviations from the grand mean an error variance based on

treatment means and a treatment variance the treatment variance is
based on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean the
result being multiplied by the number of observations in each
treatment to account for the difference between the variance of


the fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total sum of squares statistics ss into components related to the effects used in the model for example the model for a simplified anova with one type of treatment at different levels



the number of degrees of freedom statistics df can be partitioned in a similar way one of these components that for error specifies a distribution which describes the associated sum of squares while the same is true for treatments if there is no treatment effect







the is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation for example in or anova statistical significance is tested for by comparing the f test statistic





where ms is mean square i number of treatments and


to the with i i degrees of freedom using the is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled distribution



which is for no treatment effect as values of f increase above the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis two apparent experimental methods of increasing f are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls

there are two methods of concluding the anova hypothesis test both of which produce the same result


the anova is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors ie maximizing power for a fixed significance level for example to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect the closely approximate the permutation tests the approximation is particularly close when the design is balancedhinkelmann and kempthorne volume section completely randomized crd with unequal numbers of replications such permutation tests characterize uniformly most powerful test against all alternative hypothesis as observed by rosenbaumrosenbaum page cites section permutation tests theorem actually theorem page of erich leo lehmanns testing statistical hypotheses the anova of the that all treatments have exactly the same effect is recommended as a practical test because of its robustness against many alternative distributionsmoore and mccabe page for the comparison of variances has a mixed reputation it
is not recommended as a hypothesis test to determine whether two
different samples have the same variance it is recommended for
anova where two estimates of the variance of the same
sample are compared while the is not generally robust against
departures from normality it has been found to be robust in the

analysis of variance uses f statistics but these are not
the same as the f statistic for comparing two population standard
deviations page the f test and other procedures for inference
about variances are so lacking in robustness as to be of little use in




is not robust moore mccabe recommend a rule of thumb



and hypothesis testing can be used individually anova is used to
support other statistical tools regression is first used to fit more
complex models to data then anova is used to compare models with the

data such models could be fit without any reference to anova but
anova tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models

we think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring
multilevel as an alternative to regression but as a tool




the simplest experiment suitable for anova analysis is the completely

with a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include



discussion of the analysis models data summaries anova table of



for a single factor there are some alternatives of analysis of namely heteroscedastic f test heteroscedastic f test with trimmed means and winsorized variances test alexandergovern test james second order test and test available in onewaytests r package



anova generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors



are more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the




the use of anova to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication in a anova with factors x y and z the anova model includes terms for the main effects x y z and terms for interaction statistics xy xz yz xyz
all terms require hypothesis tests the proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance fortunately experience says that high order interactions are rarebelle section interactions occur rarely
the ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple
factor anova testing one factor at a time hides interactions but



interaction terms first and expand the analysis beyond anova if




estimated treatment effects can be taken at face value a
significant interaction will often mask the significance of main effectsmontgomery section introduction to factorial basic definitions and principles graphical methods are recommended
to enhance understanding regression is often useful a lengthy discussion of interactions is available in cox
chapter basic ideas about factorial some interactions can be removed by transformations while others cannot

a variety of techniques are used with multiple factor anova to reduce expense one technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication possibly no replication with support of tukeys test of additivity and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically or practically insignificant an experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replicationsmontgomery section introduction to factorial the factorial one observation per cell



some analysis is required in support of the design of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses because experimentation is iterative the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments





in the design of an experiment the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment experimentation is often sequential

early experiments are often designed to provide estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important in this case the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power among other goals

reporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisionswilkinson p the analysis which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards

besides the power analysis there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units these include graphical methods based on limiting
the probability of false negative errors graphical methods based on an expected variation increase above the residuals and methods based on achieving a desired confidence intervalmontgomery section determining sample size


statistical power is often applied in the context of anova in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain anova design effect size in the population sample size and significance level power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is truehowell chapter powerhowell section power section power analysis for factorial experimentsmoore and mccabe pp



several standardized measures of effect have been proposed for anova to summarize the strength of the association between a predictors and the dependent variable or the overall standardized difference of the complete model standardized estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines however while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature a measure of effect size that has immediately meaningful units may be preferable for reporting purposeswilkinson p

sometimes tests are conducted to determine whether the assumptions of anova appear to be violated residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm homoscedasticity and gross normalitymontgomery section model adequacy checking residuals should have the appearance of zero mean normal distribution noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and
modeled data values trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations


a statistically significant effect in anova is often followed by additional tests this can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned a priori and a posteriori or analysis planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are conceived only after looking at the data though the term post hoc is inconsistently used

the tests may be simple pairwise comparisons of individual group means or may be compound comparisons eg comparing the mean pooling across groups a b and c to the mean of group d comparisons can also look at tests of trend such as linear and quadratic relationships when the independent variable involves ordered levels often the tests incorporate a method of adjusting for the multiple comparisons problem


there are several types of anova many statisticians base anova on the experimental designcochran cox p
the general rule is that the way in which the experiment is conducted determines not only whether inferences can be made but also the calculations required to make especially on the protocol that specifies the random assignment of treatments to the protocols description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any blocking statistics it is also common to apply anova to observational data using an appropriate statistical model


















balanced experiments those with an equal sample size for each treatment are relatively easy to unbalanced
experiments offer more complexity for anova the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and powermontgomery section unbalanced data for more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications the orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case this means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply
consequently the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designsmontgomery section unbalanced data in factorial design in the general case the analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data but then the sums of squares mean squares and will depend on the order in which the sources of variation
are considered the simplest techniques for handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data or by synthesizing missing data more complex techniques use regression

anova is in part a test of statistical significance the american psychological association and many other organisations holds the view that simply reporting statistical significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred


anova is considered to be a special case of linear regressiongelman with qualification in the later textmontgomery section the regression approach to the analysis of variance which in turn is a special case of the general linear modelhowell p all consider the observations to be the sum of a model fit and a residual error to be minimized

the test and the friedman test are nonparametric tests which do not rely on an assumption of normalityhowell chapter resampling and nonparametric approaches to datamontgomery section nonparametric methods in the analysis of variance


below we make clear the connection between anova and linear regression

linearly the data so that observation is associated with a response and factors where b denotes the different factors and b is the total number of factors in anova and in anova furthermore we assume the factor has levels namely now we can encode the factors into the dimensional vector

the encoding function is defined such that the entry of is




the vector is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all b thus in order to obtain a fully general interaction anova we must also concatenate every additional interaction term in the vector and then add an intercept term let that vector be

with this notation in place we now have the exact connection with linear regression we simply regress response against the vector however there is a concern about identifiability in order to overcome such issues we assume that the sum of the parameters within each set of interactions is equal to zero from here one can use or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors


we can consider the interaction example where we assume that the first factor has levels and the second factor has levels

define if and if ie a is the encoding of the first factor and b is the encoding of the second factor





where the last term is an intercept term for a more concrete example suppose that





















































































































































































































analysis of variance a statistical method in which the variation in a set of observations is divided into distinct components

























in organic chemistry an alkane or paraffin a historical trivial name that also has paraffin is an compound saturated and unsaturated compounds hydrocarbon in other words an alkane consists of hydrogen and carbon atoms arranged in a tree graph theory structure in which all the bonds are single bond alkanes have the general chemical formula the alkanes range in complexity from the simplest case of methane where sometimes called the parent molecule to arbitrarily large and complex molecules like higher to tetrapentacontane or octane an isomer of tetradecane

the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac defines alkanes as acyclic branched or unbranched hydrocarbons having the general formula and therefore consisting entirely of hydrogen atoms and saturated carbon atoms however some sources use the term to denote any saturated hydrocarbon including those that are either monocyclic ie the cycloalkanes or polycyclic despite their having a distinct general formula ie cycloalkanes are

in an alkane each carbon atom is orbital hybridisation with sigma bond either or bond and each hydrogen atom is joined to one of the carbon atoms in a bond the longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its skeletal formula or carbon backbone the number of carbon atoms may be considered as the size of the alkane

one group of the higher alkanes are waxes solids at standard conditions for temperature and pressure satp for which the number of carbon atoms in the carbon backbone is greater than about
with their repeated units the alkanes constitute a homologous series of organic compounds in which the members differ in molecular mass by multiples of unit the total mass of each such methylene bridge unit which comprises a single carbon atom of mass and two hydrogen atoms of mass each

methane is produced by methanogen and some alkanes function as pheromones in certain animal species or as protective waxes in plants and fungi nevertheless most alkanes do not have much biological activity they can be viewed as molecular trees upon which can be hung the more functional group of biological molecules

the alkanes have two main commercial sources petroleum crude oil and natural gas

an alkyl group is an molecular fragment that bears one open valence for bonding they are generally abbreviated with the symbol for any organyl group r although alk is sometimes used to specifically symbolize an alkyl group as opposed to an alkenyl group or aryl group



saturated hydrocarbons are hydrocarbons having only single covalent bonds between their carbons they can be




according to the definition by international union of pure and applied chemistry the former two are alkanes whereas the third group is called cycloalkanes saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear cyclic eg polycyclic and branching the general formula is where k is the number of independent loops alkanes are the open chain compound loopless ones corresponding to


hydrocarbons alkanes and cycloalkanes left to right and isobutane are the two cyclobutane and methylcyclopropane are the two alkane isomers bicyclobutane is the only alkane and has no alkane tetrahedrane below is the only alkane and so has no alkane



alkanes with more than three carbon atoms can be arranged in various ways forming structural isomers the simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches this isomer is sometimes called the n for normal although it is not necessarily the most common however the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points the number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms for example for acyclic encyclopedia of integer sequences











branched alkanes can be chirality chemistry for example and its higher homology chemistry are chiral due to their stereogenic center at carbon atom number the above list only includes differences of connectivity not stereochemistry in addition to the alkane isomers the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more rings such compounds are called cycloalkanes and are also excluded from the above list because changing the number of rings changes the molecular formula cyclobutane and methylcyclopropane are isomers of each other but are not isomers of butane



the iupac nomenclature of organic systematic way of naming compounds for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains unbranched saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix

in august wilhelm von hofmann suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a e i o and u to create suffixes or for the hydrocarbons alkane nomenclature now the first three name hydrocarbons with single double and triple the ending is applied in some cases where von hofmann had represents a represents an alcohol or oh means an ether and refers to oxygen between two carbons so that methoxymethane is the iupac name for dimethyl ether

it is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one international union of pure and applied chemistry name this is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets numbers in the name referring to which carbon a group is attached to should be as low as possible so that is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name



alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix or normal where a isomer exists although this is not strictly necessary the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the and isomers eg butane rather than simply butane to distinguish it from isobutane alternative names for this group are linear paraffins or

the first six members of the series in terms of number of carbon atoms are named as follows







the first four names were from methanol diethyl ether propionic acid and butyric acid alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the affix to the appropriate iupac numerical multiplier prefix with elision of any terminal vowel or from the basic numerical term hence pentane hexane heptane octane etc the numeral prefix is generally greek however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine for example nonane use the latin language prefix for a more complete list see list of alkanes



simple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes for example pentane isopentane and neopentane

iupac naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name

the key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows
























though technically distinct from the alkanes this class of hydrocarbons is referred to by some as the cyclic alkanes as their description implies they contain one or more rings

simple cycloalkanes have a prefix to distinguish them from alkanes cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones eg cyclopentane is a cycloalkane with carbon atoms just like pentane but they are joined up in a ring in a similar manner propane and cyclopropane butane and cyclobutane etc

substituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes the cycloalkane ring is stated and the substituents are according to their position on the ring with the numbering decided by the priority rules



the trivial nomenclature name for alkanes is paraffins together alkanes are known as the paraffin series trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts they were coined before the development of systematic names and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes

it is almost certain that the term paraffin stems from the petrochemical industry alkanes are called isoparaffins the use of the term paraffin is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of isomers ie compounds of the same chemical formula eg pentane and isopentane


the following trivial names are retained in the iupac system










all alkanes are colorless alkanes with the lowest molecular weights are gasses those of intermediate molecular weight are liquids and the heaviest are waxy solids































































































































































































alkanes experience intermolecular van der waals forces stronger intermolecular van der waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes

there are two determinants for the strength of the van der waals forces



under standard conditions from to alkanes are from to they are and after they are solids as the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size molecular weight of the molecule as a rule of thumb the boiling point rises for each carbon added to the this rule applies to other homologous series

a alkane will have a boiling point higher than a alkane due to the greater surface area in contact thus the greater van der waals forces between adjacent molecules for example compare isobutane and butane which boil at and and and which boil at and respectively for the latter case two molecules can lock into each other better than the hence the greater van der waals forces

on the other hand cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules which give a plane of intermolecular contact


the melting points of the alkanes follow a similar trend to boiling points for the same reason as outlined above that is all other things being equal the larger the molecule the higher the melting point there is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids this rigid structure requires energy to break down thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart for alkanes this can be seen from the graph above ie the blue line the alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes this is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase forming a structure which requires more energy to break apart the alkanes pack less well and so the looser organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart for a visualization of the crystal structures see visualization of crystal structures

the melting points of alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding alkanes again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase this is particularly true for isoalkanes isomers which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues


alkanes do not conduct electricity in any way nor are they substantially relative static permittivity by an electric field for this reason they do not form hydrogen bonds and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order a reduction in entropy as there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water alkanes are said to be hydrophobe as they repel water

their solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively high a property that is called lipophilicity alkanes are for example miscible in all proportions among themselves

the density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water hence alkanes form the upper layer in an mixture



the molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics it is derived from the electron configuration of carbon which has four valence electrons the carbon atoms in alkanes are always that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the orbital and the three orbitals these orbitals which have identical energies are arranged spatially in the form of a tetrahedron the angle of between them


an alkane has only and single bonds the former result from the overlap of an orbital of carbon with the orbital of a the latter by the overlap of two orbitals on adjacent carbon atoms the bond lengths amount to for a bond and for a bond


the spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four are tetrahedrally arranged with an angle of between them structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another while both common and useful do not correspond with the reality




the structural formula and the bond angles are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule there is a further degrees of freedom physics and chemistry for each bond the torsion angle between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond the spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its conformational isomerism
projection projections of the two conformations of ethane eclipsed on the left staggered on the


ethane forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes as there is only one bond if one looks down the axis of the bond one will see the newman projection the hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of between them resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane however the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between and this is a consequence of the free rotation about a single bond despite this apparent freedom only two limiting conformations are important eclipsed conformation and staggered conformation

the two conformations differ in energy the staggered conformation is lower in energy more stable than the eclipsed conformation the least stable

this difference in energy between the two conformations known as the torsion energy is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature there is constant rotation about the bond the time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next equivalent to the rotation of one group by relative to the other is of the order of

the case of higher alkanes is more complex but based on similar principles with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each bond for this reason alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models the actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules alkane molecules have no fixed structural form whatever the models may suggest



virtually all organic compounds contain and bonds and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra alkanes are notable for having no other groups and therefore for the absence of other characteristic spectroscopic features of a functional group like alcohol chemistry aldehyde carboxylic acid etc


the stretching mode gives a strong absorption between and while the stretching mode absorbs between and the bending modes depend on the nature of the group methyl groups show bands at and while methylene groups show bands at and carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around


the proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at chemical shift the resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon primary methyl secondary methylene tertiary methyne and quaternary the resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak due to the lack of nuclear overhauser effect and the long relaxation time and can be missed in weak samples or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time


alkanes have a high ionization energy and the molecular ion is usually weak the fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret but in the case of branched chain alkanes the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting free radicals the fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group is often absent and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units corresponding to sequential loss of groups



alkanes are only weakly reactive with most chemical compounds the acid dissociation constant pka values of all alkanes are estimated to range from to depending on the extrapolation method hence they are extremely weak acids that are practically inert to bases see carbon acids they are also extremely weak bases undergoing no observable protonation in pure sulfuric acid although superacids that are at least millions of times stronger have been known to protonate them to give hypercoordinate alkanium ions see methanium similarly they only show reactivity with the strongest of electrophilic reagents eg dioxiranes and salts containing the tetrafluoroammonium by virtue of their strongly bonds and bonds but usually less sterically accessible they are also relatively unreactive toward free radicals although many radicals will react with alkanes in the absence of other bonds see below this inertness is the source of the term paraffins with the meaning here of lacking affinity in crude oil the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years

free radicals molecules with unpaired electrons play a large role in most reactions of alkanes such as cracking and reformation where alkanes are converted into alkanes and alkanes into isomers moreover redox reactions of alkanes involving free radical intermediates in particular with oxygen and the halogens are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced in the case of methane carbon is in its lowest possible oxidation state reaction with oxygen if present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction stoichiometry leads to combustion without any smoke producing carbon dioxide and water free radical halogenation reactions occur with halogens leading to the production of haloalkanes in addition alkanes have been shown to interact with and bind to certain transition metal complexes in bond activation reactions

in highly branched alkanes the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value to accommodate bulky groups such distortions introduce a tension in the molecule known as steric hindrance or strain strain substantially increases reactivity

however in general and perhaps surprisingly when branching is not extensive enough to make highly disfavorable and steric interactions worth and in the case of the eclipsing conformations of butane and pentane respectively unavoidable the branched alkanes are actually more thermodynamically stable than their linear or less branched isomers for example the highly branched is about more stable than its linear isomer due to the subtlety of this effect the exact reasons for this rule have been vigorously debated in the chemical literature and is yet unsettled several explanations including stabilization of branched alkanes by electron correlation destabilization of linear alkanes by steric repulsion stabilization by neutral hyperconjugation electrostatic effects have been advanced as possibilities the controversy is related to the question of whether the traditional explanation of hyperconjugation is the primary factor governing the stability of alkyl radicals


all alkanes react with oxygen in a combustion reaction although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases the general equation for complete combustion is



in the absence of sufficient oxygen carbon monoxide or even soot can be formed as shown below









see the standard enthalpy change of formation data for detailed data
the standard enthalpy change of combustion for alkanes increases by about per group alkanes have lower values of than alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable



alkanes react with halogens in a free radical halogenation reaction the hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms free radicals are the reactive species that participate in the reaction which usually leads to a mixture of products the reaction is highly exothermic reaction and can lead to an explosion

these reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons there are three steps




experiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction the mixture produced however is not a statistical mixture secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary an example can be seen in the monobromination of propane




cracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones this can be done with a thermal or catalytic method the thermal cracking process follows a homolysis chemistry mechanism with formation of the catalytic cracking process involves the presence of acid catalysts usually solid acids such as and zeolites which promote a heterolytic cleavage asymmetric breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges usually a carbocation and the very unstable hydride anion free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement scission in position beta scission ie cracking and intramolecular reaction and intermolecular hydrogen transfer or hydride transfer in both types of processes the corresponding reactive intermediates radicals ions are permanently regenerated and thus they proceed by a chain mechanism the chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination


dragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes isomerization and reformation are processes in which alkanes are heated in the presence of a platinum catalyst in isomerization the alkanes become isomers in other words it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens keeping the same molecular weight in reformation the alkanes become cycloalkanes or aromatic hydrocarbons giving off hydrogen as a both of these processes raise the octane number of the substance butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers


alkanes will react with steam in the presence of a nickel catalyst to give hydrogen alkanes can be chlorosulfonation and nitration although both reactions require special conditions the fermentation biochemistry of alkanes to carboxylic acids is of some technical importance in the reed reaction sulfur dioxide chlorine and photochemistry convert hydrocarbons to sulfonic acid nucleophilic abstraction can be used to separate an alkane from a metal alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by transmetalation reactions a mixture of antimony pentafluoride and fluorosulfonic acid called magic acid can protonate alkanes







alkanes form a small portion of the celestial body atmosphere of the outer gas planets such as jupiter methane per million ethane saturn methane ethane uranus methane ethane and neptune methane ethane titan moon methane a satellite of saturn was examined by the huygens spacecraft which indicated that titans atmosphere periodically rains liquid methane onto the moons surface also on titan the cassini mission has imaged seasonal lakes near the polar regions of titan methane and ethane have also been detected in the tail of the comet hyakutake chemical analysis showed that the abundances of ethane and methane were roughly equal which is thought to imply that its ices formed in interstellar space away from the sun which would have evaporated these volatile molecules alkanes have also been detected in meteorites such as carbonaceous chondrites


traces of methane gas about or occur in the earths atmosphere produced primarily by methanogenesis microorganisms such as archaea in the gut of ruminants

the most important commercial sources for alkanes are natural gas and petroleum natural gas contains primarily methane and ethane with some propane and butane oil is a mixture of liquid alkanes and other hydrocarbons these hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants zooplankton and phytoplankton died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an wiktanoxic environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction


these hydrocarbon deposits collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks comprise commercial oil fields they have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced the depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the energy crisis

methane is also present in what is called biogas produced by animals and decaying matter which is a possible renewable energy source

alkanes have a low solubility in water so the content in the oceans is however at high pressures and low temperatures such as at the bottom of the oceans methane can with water to form a solid methane clathrate methane hydrate although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together methane extracted from methane clathrate is therefore a candidate for future fuels





archaea in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the methane in earths
certain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes they prefer carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than chains

on the other hand certain archaea the methanogens produce large quantities of methane by the metabolism of carbon dioxide or other oxidation organic compounds the energy is released by the oxidation of hydrogen


methanogens are also the producers of marsh gas in wetlands the methane output of cattle and other herbivores which can release to gallons per day and of termites is also due to methanogens they also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the intestines of humans methanogenic archaea are hence at the end of the carbon cycle with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by photosynthesis it is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way


alkanes also play a role if a minor role in the biology of the three eukaryote groups of organisms fungus plants and animals some specialized yeasts eg candida tropicale pichia sp rhodotorula sp can use alkanes as a source of carbon or energy the fungus amorphotheca resinae prefers the alkanes in aviation fuel and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions

in plants the solid alkanes are found in the plant cuticle and epicuticular wax of many species but are only rarely major constituentsea baker chemistry and morphology of plant epicuticular waxes pp in the plant cuticle edited by df cutler kl alvin and ce price academic press london they protect the plant against water loss prevent the leaching agriculture of important minerals by the rain and protect against bacteria fungi and harmful insects the carbon chains in plant alkanes are usually between and carbon atoms in length and are made by the plants by decarboxylation of fatty acids the exact composition of the layer of wax is not only but changes also with the season and such environmental factors as lighting conditions temperature or humidity

more volatile alkanes are also produced by and found in plant tissues the jeffrey pine is noted for producing exceptionally high levels of in its resin for which reason its distillate was designated as the zero point for one octane rating floral scents have also long been known to contain volatile alkane components and is a significant component in the scent of some roses emission of gaseous and volatile alkanes such as ethane pentane and hexane by plants has also been documented at low levels though they are not generally considered to be a major component of biogenic air pollution

edible vegetable oils also typically contain small fractions of biogenic alkanes with a wide spectrum of carbon numbers mainly to usually peaking in the low to upper with concentrations up to dozens of milligrams per kilogram parts per million by weight and sometimes over a hundred for the total alkane journal moreda



alkanes are found in animal products although they are less important than unsaturated hydrocarbons one example is the shark liver oil which is approximately pristane they are important as pheromones chemical messenger materials on which insects depend for communication in some species eg the support beetle xylotrechus colonus pentacosane and are transferred by body contact with others like the tsetse fly glossina morsitans morsitans the pheromone contains the four alkanes and and acts by smell over longer distances waggle dance honey bees produce and release two alkanes tricosane and pentacosane



one example in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role is the ecological relationship between the sand bee andrena nigroaenea and the early spider orchid ophrys the latter is dependent for pollination on the former sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a in the case of a nigroaenea the females emit a mixture of tricosane pentacosane and heptacosane in the ratio and males are attracted by specifically this odor the orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees as a result numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen
which will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to other blooms





as stated earlier the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and crude oil alkanes are separated in an oil refinery by fractional distillation and processed into many products


the process is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons including alkanes from carbon monoxide and hydrogen this method is used to produce substitutes for petroleum distillates


there is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory since they are usually commercially available also alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically and do not undergo functional group interconversions cleanly when alkanes are produced in the laboratory it is often a of a reaction for example the use of as a strong base chemistry gives the conjugate acid as a



however at times it may be desirable to make a section of a molecule into an functionality alkyl group using the above or similar methods for example an ethyl group is an alkyl when this is attached to a hydroxyl group it gives ethanol which is not an alkane to do so the methods are hydrogenation of alkenes



alkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from alkyl halides in the synthesis the deoxygenation removes hydroxyl groups from alcohols eg


and the clemmensen reductionbuchanan j g st woodgate p d quart rev reviewyamamura nishiyama s compr org synth review removes carbonyl groups from aldehydes and ketones to form alkanes or compounds eg




alkanes can be prepared from a variety of organic compoundsthese include alkenes alkynes haloalkanes alcohols aldehydes and ketones and carboxylic acids



when alkenes and alkynes are subjected to hydrogenation reaction by treating them with hydrogen in the presence of palladium or platinum or nickel catalyst they produce alkanes in this reaction powdered catalyst is preferred to increase the surface area so that adsorption of hydrogen on the catalyst increases in this reaction the hydrogen gets attached on the catalyst to form a bond which leads to weakening of bond thereby leading to the addition of hydrogen on alkenes and alkynes the reaction is exothermic because the product alkane is stable as it has more sigma bonds than the reactant alkenes and alkynes due to conversion of pi bond to sigma bondsharikiranb k e mannanam kottayam







when haloalkane is treated with sodium in dry ether alkane with double the number of carbon atoms is obtained this reaction proceeds through free radical intermediate and has possibility of alkene formation in case of tertiary haloalkanes and vicinal dihalides



when haloalkane is treated with dialkyl lithium cuprite which is otherwise known as gilmans reagent any higher alkane is obtained



when haloalkanes are treated with metal hydride eg sodium hydride and lithium aluminium hydride



when haloalkane is treated with zinc in ester alkane is obtained



when aryl halide is treated with sodium in dry ether it forms biphenyl



when aryl halide is treated with copper it forms biphenyl



when aryl halide is treated with haloalkane we get alkyl benzene


the applications of alkanes depend on the number of carbon atoms the first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes and in some countries for electricity generation methane and ethane are the main components of natural they are normally stored as gases under pressure it is however easier to transport them as liquids this requires both compression and cooling of the gas

propane and butane are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as liquified petroleum gas lpg propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters both are used as propellants in aerosol sprays

from pentane to octane the alkanes are highly volatile liquids they are used as fuels in internal combustion engines as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets which would impair the uniformity of the combustion alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition which causes engine knocking than their homologues this propensity to premature ignition is measured by the octane rating of the fuel where isooctane has an arbitrary value of and heptane has a value of zero apart from their use as fuels the middle alkanes are also good solvents for nonpolar substances

alkanes from nonane to for instance hexadecane an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms are liquids of higher viscosity less and less suitable for use in gasoline they form instead the major part of diesel fuel and aviation fuel diesel fuels are characterized by their cetane number cetane being an old name for hexadecane however the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly

alkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of fuel oil and lubricating oil in the latter function they work at the same time as agents as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface many solid alkanes find use as paraffin wax for example in candles this should not be confused however with true wax which consists primarily of esters

alkanes with a chain length of approximately or more carbon atoms are found in bitumen used for example in road surfacing however the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by cracking chemistry

some synthetic polymers such as polyethylene and polypropylene are alkanes with chains containing hundreds or thousands of carbon atoms these materials are used in innumerable applications and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year



alkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds this inertness yields serious ecological issues if they are released into the environment due to their lack of functional groups and low water solubility alkanes show poor bioavailability for microorganisms

there are however some microorganisms possessing the metabolic capacity to utilize as both carbon and energy sources some bacterial species are highly specialised in degrading these are referred to as hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria





methane is flammable explosive and dangerous to because it is a colorless odorless gas special caution must be taken around methane ethane is also extremely flammable explosive and dangerous to inhale both of them may cause suffocation propane too is flammable and explosive and may cause drowsiness or unconsciousness if inhaled butane presents the same hazards as propane

alkanes also pose a threat to the environment branched alkanes have a lower biodegradability than unbranched alkanes methane is considered to be the greenhouse gas that is most dangerous to the environment although the amount of methane in the atmosphere is relatively low




















































united states appellate procedure involves the rules and regulations for filing appeals in state court united states and united states federal courts the nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the jurisdiction where the case was prosecuted there are many types of standard of review for appeals such as trial de novo and abuse of discretion however most appeals begin when a party files a petition for review to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower courts decision

an appellate court is a court that hears cases on appeal from another court depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance a party to a court case who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds these grounds typically could include errors of law fact procedure or due process in different jurisdictions appellate courts are also called appeals courts courts of appeals superior courts or supreme courts

the specific procedures for appealing including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision can vary greatly from state to state the right to file an appeal can also vary from state to for example the new jersey constitution vests judicial power in a supreme court a superior court and other courts of limited jurisdiction with an appellate court being part of the superior courtjeffrey s mandel new jersey appellate practice gann law books chapter


a party who files an appeal is called an appellant plaintiff in error petitioner or pursuer and a party on the other side is called an appellee a is an appeal brought by the respondent for example suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay if the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money then the plaintiff might file a arguing that the defendant should have to pay instead of

the appellant is the party who having lost part or all their lawsuit in a lower court decision is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered this is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence

the appellant in the new case can be either the plaintiff or claimant defendant intervenor or respondent appellee from the lower case depending on who was the losing party the winning party from the lower court however is now the respondent in unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below but still appeal

an appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court judgment law was in its favor the appellee is required to respond to the petition oral arguments and legal briefs of the appellant in general the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower courts decision should be affirmed


an appeal as of right is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle the appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal an appeal by leave or permission requires the appellant to obtain leave to in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellants demand to appeal the lower courts decision in the united states supreme court review in most cases is available only if the court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari

in tort equity law or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal in criminal matters however the state or prosecution generally has no appeal as of right and due to the double jeopardy principle the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal but in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal as of right from a trial courts dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial courts granting of a defendants suppression motion likewise in some jurisdictions the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law by leave from the trial court or the appellate court the ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally all parties must present grounds to appeal or it will not be heard

by convention in some law reports the appellant is named first this can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals the name of the case in the law reports reverses in some cases twice as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy this is not always true however in the united states federal courts the parties names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the united states courts of appeals and are only if the appeal reaches the united states supreme court


many jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals particularly in the criminal context the first is the traditional direct appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review the second is the collateral appeal or petition in which the files the appeal in a court of first the court that tried the case

the key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts and the latter in federal courts

relief in is rare and is most often found in capital punishment or violent felony cases the typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating dna evidence demonstrating the defendants actual innocence


appellate review is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate jurisdiction take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts it is distinguished from judicial review theory which refers to the courts overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons which may vary by jurisdiction

in most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final legal judgment generally an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case this is because such orders cannot be appealed as of right however certain critical interlocutory court orders such as the denial of a request for an interim injunction or an order holding a person in contempt of court can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of

there are two distinct forms of appellate review direct and collateral for example a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court and lose on direct appeal to higher state appellate courts and if unsuccessful mount a collateral action such as filing for a writ of habeas corpus in the united states federal courts generally speaking direct appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact collateral review on the other hand provides an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional jurisdictional or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial graham v borgen f cir no slip op at citation omitted

in common law courts appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by prerogative writ in certain cases there is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental civil law legal system legal systems though some mixed systems such as civil code of quebec recognize these prerogative writs


after exhausting the first appeal as of right defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision this appeal is known as a direct appeal the highest state court generally known as the supreme court exercises discretion over whether it will review the case on direct appeal a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process


an appellants claims must usually be preserved at trial this means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial because constitutional claims are of great magnitude appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved for example connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims record is adequate to review the alleged claim of the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair if subject to harmless error analysis the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt


all states have a relief process similar to federal relief an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review typical claims might include ineffective assistance of counsel and actual innocence based on new evidence these proceedings are normally separate from the direct appeal however some states allow for collateral relief to be sought on direct appeal after direct appeal the conviction is considered final an appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal that is it goes to the intermediate appellate court followed by the highest court if the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration the sentence could be modified or a new trial could be ordered





a notice of appeal is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal the form is completed by the appellant or by the appellants legal representative the nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country

the specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun for example the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court or with the court from which the appeal is taken or both

some courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the courts own web site in new jersey for example the administrative office of the court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is usedjeffrey s mandel new jersey appellate practice gann law books

the deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short traditionally it is measured in days not months this can vary from country to country as well as within a country depending on the specific rules in force in the us federal court system criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed or the right to appeal is forfeited



generally speaking the appellate court examines the record of evidence law presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not the appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower courts findings of fact such as whether a defendant committed a particular act unless clearly erroneous and so will focus on the courts application of the law to those facts such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue

if the appellate court finds no defect it affirms the judgment if the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision below ie in the lower court it may modify the ruling to correct the defect or it may nullify reverse or vacate the whole decision or any part of it it may in addition send the case back remand or remit to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect

in some cases an appellate court may review a lower court decision de novo or completely challenging even the lower courts findings of fact this might be the proper standard of review for example if the lower court resolved the case by granting a motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony

another situation is where appeal is by way of certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court

sometimes the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below this would happen for example if the appellant waited too long under the appellate courts rules to file the appeal

generally there is no jury trial in an appellate court only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the and trial court proceedings are the appeal is by way of new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in very rare instances for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as prosecutorial misconduct

in some systems an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal in other systems the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court in those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court

the appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee or respondent can present arguments against it arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers if represented or pro se if the party has not engaged legal representation those arguments are presented in written brief law and sometimes in oral argument to the court at a hearing law at such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs

in an adversarial system appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it therefore if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner or against precedent that judgment will stand if not appealed even if it might have been overturned on appeal

the united states legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals a trial de novo or an appeal on the record

a trial de novo is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial trial law if unchallenged these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all if a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal one generally has the power to request a trial de novo by a court of record in such a proceeding all issues and evidence law may be developed newly as though never heard before and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding sometimes however the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence thus helping to curb frivolous appeals

in some cases an application for trial de novo effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place the supreme court of virginia has stated that this court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trialgaskill v commonwealth va the only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses where they are convicted on a lesser offense the appeal is of the lesser the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses a trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles subject only to the limitation that conviction in the district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense
permitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the offensekenyon v commonwealth va app

in an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result precedent and case law figure prominently in the arguments in order for the appeal to succeed the appellant must prove that the lower court committed reversible error that is an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case permitting seriously improper argument by an attorney admitting or excluding evidence improperly acting outside the courts jurisdiction injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so juror misconduct etc the failure to formally object at the time to what one views as improper action in the lower court may result in the affirmance of the lower courts judgment on the grounds that one did not preserve the issue for appeal by objecting

in cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact an appellate court will apply an abuse of discretion standard of review under this standard the appellate court gives deference to the lower courts view of the evidence and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion this is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness on the other hand the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower courts decision on issues of law and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard

in some cases an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was constitutionality or otherwise invalid or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered in the case of new evidence there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel if a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation he is entitled to a new trial

a lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words may it please the court

after an appeal is heard the mandate is a formal notice of a decision by a court of this notice is transmitted to the trial court and when filed by the court clerk of the trial court constitutes the final judgment on the case unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court the mandate is distinguished from the appeal courts court opinion which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision in some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the remittitur








there can be multiple outcomes so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings reverse others and remand the case all at the same time remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case generally speaking an appellate courts judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed setting out with specificity the courts determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed reversed remanded or modifiedstate v randolph nj citing mandel new jersey appellate practice gann law books chapter

some reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than review improvidently granted in other words after looking at the case they chose not to say anything the result for the case of review improvidently granted is effectively the same as affirmed but without that extra higher court stamp of approval





















































in law an answer was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something and thus generally any or defense legal a reply to a question or response or objection law or a correct solution of a problem

in the common law an answer is the first pleading by a defendant usually filed and served upon the plaintiff within a certain strict time limit after a civil complaint or criminal information formal criminal charge or indictment has been served upon the defendant it may have been preceded by an optional motion to dismiss or if such a motion is unsuccessful the defendant must file an answer to the complaint or risk an adverse default judgment

in a criminal case there is usually an arraignment or some other kind of appearance before the defendant comes to court the pleading in the criminal case which is entered on the record in open court is usually either guilt lawy or not guilty generally speaking in private civil cases there is no plea entered of guilt or innocence there is only a judgment that grants money damages or some other kind of equitable remedy such as restitution or a permanent injunction criminal cases may lead to fine penaltys or other punishment such as imprisonment

the famous latin responsa prudentium answers of the learned ones were the accumulated views of many successive generations of roman lawyers a body of legal opinion which gradually became authoritative

during debates of a contentious nature deflection colloquially known as changing the topic has been widely observed and is often seen as a failure to answer a question
































an appellate court commonly called an appeals court court of appeals american english appeal court court of appeal british english court of second instance or second instance court is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal in most jurisdictions the court system is divided into at least three levels the trial court which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the at least one intermediate appellate and a supreme court or court of last resort which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts a jurisdictions supreme court is that jurisdictions highest appellate court appellate courts nationwide can operate under varying rules

the authority of appellate courts to review the decisions of lower courts varies widely from one jurisdiction to another in some areas the appellate court has limited powers of review generally an appellate courts judgment provides the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed setting out with specificity the courts determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed reversed remanded or modifiedstate v randolph nj citing mandel new jersey appellate practice gann law books chapter


while many appellate courts have jurisdiction over all cases decided by lower courts some systems have appellate courts divided by the type of jurisdiction they exercise some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts such as the texas court of criminal appeals which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases and the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases on one hand and appeals from the court of federal claims on the other in the united states alabama tennessee and oklahoma also have separate courts of criminal appeals texas and oklahoma have the final determination of criminal cases vested in their respective courts of criminal appeals while alabama and tennessee allow decisions of its court of criminal appeals to be finally appealed to the state supreme court



























the court of appeal of new zealand located in wellington is new zealands principal intermediate appellate court in practice most appeals are resolved at this intermediate appellate level rather than in the supreme court of new zealand




the court of appeal of sri lanka located in colombo is the second senior court in the courts of sri lanka






in the united states both state and united states courts of appeals appellate courts are usually restricted to examining whether the lower court made the correct legal determinations rather than hearing direct evidence and determining what the facts of the case were furthermore us appellate courts are usually restricted to hearing appeals based on matters that were originally brought up before the trial court hence such an appellate court will not consider an appellants argument if it is based on a theory that is raised for the first time in the courts work public

in most us states and in us federal courts parties before the court are allowed one appeal as of right this means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an appeal to contest that outcome however appeals may be costly and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict therefore only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals some appellate courts particularly supreme courts have the power of discretionary review meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case


many us jurisdictions title their appellate court a court of appeal or court of appeals historically others have titled their appellate court a court of errors or court of errors and appeals on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts examples of such courts include the new jersey court of errors and appeals which existed from to the connecticut supreme court of errors which has been renamed the connecticut supreme court the kentucky court of errors renamed the kentucky supreme court and the mississippi high court of errors and appeals since renamed the supreme court of mississippi in some jurisdictions a court able to hear appeals is known as an appellate division

the phrase court of appeals most often refers to intermediate appellate courts however the maryland and new york systems are different the maryland court of appeals and the new york court of appeals are the highest appellate courts in those states the new york supreme court is a trial court of general jurisdiction depending on the system certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction



























































































arraignment is a formal reading of a crime charging document in the presence of the defendant to inform them of the charges against them in response to arraignment the accused is expected to enter a plea acceptable pleas vary among jurisdictions but they generally include guilty not guilty and the peremptory pleas or pleas in bar setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed pleas of nolo contendere no contest and the alford plea are allowed in some circumstances



in australia arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial and involves the court clerk of the court reading out the indictment the judge will testify during the indictment process



in every province in canada except british columbia defendants are arraigned on the day of their trial in british columbia arraignment takes place in one of the first few court appearances by the defendant or their lawyer the defendant is asked whether he or she pleads guilty or not guilty to each charge



in france the general rule is that one cannot remain in police custody for more than hours from the time of the arrest however police custody can last another hours in specific circumstances especially if the offence is punishable by at least one years imprisonment or if the investigation is deemed to require the extra time and can last up to hours in certain cases involving terrorism drug trafficking or organised crime the police needs to have the consent of the prosecutor in the vast majority of cases the prosecutor will consent



in germany if one has been arrested and taken into custody by the police one must be brought before a judge as soon as possible and at the latest on the day after the arrest



at the first appearance the accused is read the charges and asked for a plea the available pleas are guilty not guilty and no plea no plea allows the defendant to get legal advice on the plea which must be made on the second



in south africa arraignment is defined as the calling upon the accused to appear the informing of the accused of the crime charged against him the demanding of the accused whether he be guilty or not guilty and the entering of his plea his plea having been entered he is said to stand arraigned



in england wales and northern ireland arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial and involves the court clerk of the court reading out the indictment

in england and wales the police cannot legally detain anyone for more than hours without charging them unless an officer with the rank of superintendent or above authorises detention for a further hours hours total or a judge who will be a magistrate authorises detention by the police before charge for up to a maximum of hours but for offences people can be held by the police for up to days before charge if they are not released after being charged they should be brought before a court as soon as practicable



under the united states federal rules of criminal procedure arraignment shall consist of an open reading of the indictment to the defendant and on him to plead thereto shall be given a copy of the indictment before is called upon to plead

in federal courts arraignment takes place in two stages the first is called the initial arraignment and must take place within hours of an individuals arrest hours if the individual was arrested on the weekend and not able to go before a judge until monday during this arraignment the defendant is informed of the pending legal charges and is informed of his or her right to retain counsel the presiding judge also decides at what amount if any to set bail during the second arraignment a arraignment pia the defendant is allowed to enter a plea

in new york most people arrested must be released if they are not arraigned within hours

in california arraignments must be conducted without unnecessary delay and in any event within hours of arrest excluding weekends and holidayscounty of riverside v mclaughlin us angeles criminal court arraignments spolin law


the wording of the arraignment varies from jurisdiction to jurisdictionin some jurisdictions the wording of the arraignment is set by statute or court practice direction however it generally conforms with the following principles

the criminal charge against the accused person is read including the alleged date time and place of offense and sometimes the names of the states witnesses and the range of punishment for the and
the accused person is asked formally how he or she pleads


video arraignment is the act of conducting the arraignment process using some form of videoconferencing technology use of video arraignment system allows the courts to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the courtroom by using an link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom

use of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants the transportation of defendants requires time puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention it also addresses the rising costs of transportation


if the defendant pleads guilty an preliminary hearing usually follows the court is not required to accept a guilty plea during the hearing the judge assesses the offense the mitigating factors and the defendants character and passes sentence law

this is also often the stage at which arguments for or against release and bail may be made depending on the alleged crime and jurisdiction



























































america the beautiful is a patriotism american song its lyrics were written by katharine lee bates and its music was composed by church organist and choirmaster samuel a ward at grace church newark in newark new the beautiful began in newark di the two never metandy pease the beautiful by katharine lee bates and samuel augustus ward arr carmen dragon wind band literature july accessed

bates originally wrote the words as a poem entitled pikes peak that was first published in the fourth of july edition of the church periodical the congregationalist it was at that time that the poem was first entitled america

ward had initially composed the songs melody in to accompany lyrics to materna basis of the hymn o mother dear jerusalem though the hymn was not first published until mckim notes that ward once mentioned in a postcard that the hymn had been composed in however the combination of wards melody and batess poem was first entitled america the beautiful in the song is one of the most popular of the many us patriotic songs




in at the age of bates an english professor at wellesley college had taken a train trip to colorado springs colorado colorado to teach at colorado college several of the sights on her trip inspired her and they found their way into her poem including the worlds columbian exposition in chicago the white city with its promise of the future contained within its gleaming white the wheat fields of americas heartland kansas through which her train was riding on july and the majestic view of the great plains from high atop pikes peak

on the pinnacle of that mountain the words of the poem started to come to her and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original antlers hilton hotel the poem was initially published two years later in the congregationalist to commemorate independence day united states it quickly caught the publics fancy an amended version was published in





the first known melody written for the song was sent in by silas pratt when the poem was published in the congregationalist by at least different melodies had been written a hymn tune composed in by samuel a ward the organist and choir director at grace church newark was generally considered the best music as early as and is still the popular tune today just as bates had been inspired to write her poem ward too was inspired the tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from coney island back to his home in new york city after a leisurely summer day and he immediately wrote it down he composed the tune for the old hymn o mother dear jerusalem retitling the work materna wards music combined with batess poem were first published together in and titled america the book








ward died in not knowing the national stature his music would attain bates was more fortunate since the songs popularity was well established by the time of her death in it is included in songbooks in many religious congregations in the united states

at various times in the more than one hundred years that have elapsed since the song was written particularly during the john f kennedy administration there have been efforts to give america the beautiful legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to or in place of the banner but so far this has not succeeded proponents prefer america the beautiful for various reasons saying it is easier to sing more melodic and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as the banner some prefer america the beautiful over the banner due to the latters others prefer the banner for the same reason while that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem america the beautiful continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of americans and was even being considered before as a candidate to become the national anthem of the united states

the abacus plural abaci or abacuses also called a counting frame is a calculating tool that has been in use since ancient times and is still in use today it was used in the ancient near east europe china and russia centuries before the adoption of the written eastern arabic numerals the exact origin of the abacus is unknown the abacus essentially consists of a number of rows of movable beads or other objects which represent digits one of two numbers is set up and the beads are manipulated to implement an operation involving a second number eg addition or rarely a square or cubic root

in earliest use the rows of beads could be loose on a flat surface or sliding in grooves later the beads were made to slide on rods of some sort built into a frame allowing faster manipulation abacuses are still made often as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires in the ancient world particularly before the introduction of positional notation abacuses were a practical calculating tool

there are distinctive modern implementations of the abacus some designs like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens are used mainly to teach arithmetic although they remain popular in the states as a tool other designs such as the japanese soroban have been used for practical calculations even involving numbers of several digits for any particular abacus design there are usually numerous different methods to perform calculations which may include the four basic operations and also square root and cube roots some of these methods work with number numbers numbers such as and

although today calculators and computers are usually used instead of abacuses abacuses still remain in common use in some countries merchants traders and clerks in some parts of eastern europe russia china and africa use abacuses and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children some people who are unable to use a calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus


the use of the word abacus dates from before ad when a middle english work borrowed the word from latin to describe a sandboard abacus the latin word came from ancient greek abax which means something without base and improperly any piece of rectangular board or plank
alternatively without reference to ancient texts on etymology it has been suggested that it means a square tablet strewn with dust or covered with dust for the use of mathematics the exact shape of the latin perhaps reflects the genitive case of the greek word abakos while the table strewn with dust definition is popular some disagree saying that it is not proven greek itself is probably a borrowing of a northwest semitic language perhaps phoenician language and cognate with the hebrew language word or in sense meaning sand used as a writing surface

both abacuses and abaci soft or hard c are used as plurals the user of an abacus is called an abacist




the period bc saw the first appearance of the sumerian abacus a table of successive columns which delimited the successive orders of magnitude of their sexagesimal number system

some scholars point to a character in akkadian language which may have been derived from a representation of the abacus it is the belief of old babylonian scholars such as carruccio that old babylonians may have used the abacus for the operations of addition and however this primitive device proved difficult to use for more complex calculations


the use of the abacus in ancient egypt is mentioned by the greek historian herodotus who writes that the egyptians manipulated the pebbles from right to left opposite in direction to the greek method archaeologists have found ancient disks of various sizes that are thought to have been used as counters however wall depictions of this instrument have not been discovered


during the achaemenid empire around bc the persians first began to use the abacus under the parthian empire sassanian and iranian empires scholars concentrated on exchanging knowledge and inventions with the countries around them india china and the roman empire when it is thought to have been exported to other countries


tafel salamis tablet nach wilhelm kubitschek numismatische zeitschrift bd wien early photograph of the salamis tablet the original is marble and is held by the national museum of epigraphy in
the earliest archaeological evidence for the use of the greek abacus dates to the century bc also demosthenes bc talked of the need to use pebbles for calculations too difficult for your head a play by alexis poet from the century bc mentions an abacus and pebbles for accounting and both diogenes and polybius mention men that sometimes stood for more and sometimes for less like the pebbles on an abacus the greek abacus was a table of wood or marble with small counters in wood or metal for mathematical calculations this greek abacus saw use in achaemenid persia the etruscan civilization ancient rome and until the french revolution the western christian world

a tablet found on the greek island salamis island in ad the salamis tablet dates back to bc making it the oldest counting board discovered so far it is a slab of white marble long wide and thick on which are groups of markings in the center of the tablet is a set of parallel lines equally divided by a vertical line capped with a semicircle at the intersection of the horizontal line and the single vertical line below these lines is a wide space with a horizontal crack dividing it below this crack is another group of eleven parallel lines again divided into two sections by a line perpendicular to them but with the semicircle at the top of the the third sixth and ninth of these lines are marked with a cross where they intersect with the vertical line also from this time frame the darius vase was unearthed in it was covered with pictures including a treasurer holding a wax tablet in one hand while manipulating counters on a table with the other
















the earliest known written documentation of the chinese abacus dates to the century bc

the chinese abacus known as the suanpan lit calculating tray is typically tall and comes in various widths depending on the operator it usually has more than seven rods there are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom the beads are usually rounded and made of a hardwood the beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beads moved toward the beam are counted while those moved away from it are not one of the top beads is while one of the bottom beads is each rod has a number under it showing the place valuethe suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center

the prototype of the chinese abacus appeared during the han dynasty and the beads are oval the song dynasty and earlier used the type or abacus similar to the modern abacus including the shape of the beads commonly known as abacus

in the early ming dynasty the abacus began to appear in the form of abacus the upper deck had one bead and the bottom had five beads

in the late ming dynasty the abacus styles appeared in the form of the upper deck had two beads and the bottom had five beads

various calculation techniques were devised for suanpan enabling efficient calculations there are currently schools teaching students how to use it

in the long scroll along the river during the qingming festival painted by zhang zeduan during the song dynasty a suanpan is clearly visible beside an account book and doctors prescriptions on the counter of an apothecarys feibao

the similarity of the roman abacus to the chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the roman empire and china however no direct connection can be demonstrated and the similarity of the abacuses may be coincidental both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand where the roman model like most modern korean and abacus has plus bead per decimal place the standard suanpan has plus incidentally this allows use with a hexadecimal numeral system or any radix up to which may have been used for traditional chinese measures of weight of running on wires as in the chinese korean and japanese models the beads of roman model run in grooves presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower

another possible source of the suanpan is chinese counting rods which operated with a decimal but lacked the concept of number as a place holder the zero was probably introduced to the chinese in the tang dynasty when travel in the indian ocean and the middle east would have provided direct contact with india allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the decimal point from indian merchants and mathematicians




the normal method of calculation in ancient rome as in greece was by moving counters on a smooth table originally pebbles calculi were used later and in medieval europe jetons were manufactured marked lines indicated units fives tens etc as in the roman numeral system this system of counter casting continued into the late roman empire and in medieval europe and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century due to pope sylvester iis reintroduction of the abacus with modifications it became widely used in europe once again during the century this abacus used beads on wires unlike the traditional roman counting boards which meant the abacus could be used much faster

writing in the century bc horace refers to the wax abacus a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus

one example of archaeological evidence of the roman abacus shown here in reconstruction dates to the century ad it has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each the groove marked i indicates units x tens and so on up to millions the beads in the shorter grooves denote fives units five tens etc essentially in a coded decimal system related to the roman numerals the short grooves on the right may have been used for marking roman ounces ie fractions



the of vasubandhu a sanskrit work on buddhist philosophy says that the ce philosopher vasumitra said that placing a wick sanskrit on the number one means it is a one while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand it is unclear exactly what this arrangement may have been around the century indian clerks were already finding new ways of recording the contents of the abacus hindu texts used the term zero to indicate the empty column on the abacus




in japanese the abacus is called soroban lit counting tray imported from china in the century it was probably in use by the working class a century or more before the ruling class started as the class structure did not allow for devices used by the lower class to be adopted or used by the ruling class the abacus which removes the seldom used second and fifth bead became popular in the

todays japanese abacus is a type abacus was introduced from china in the muromachi era it adopts the form of the upper deck one bead and the bottom four beads the top bead on the upper deck was equal to five and the bottom one is equal to one like the chinese or korean abacus and the decimal number can be expressed so the abacus is designed as one four abacus the beads are always in the shape of a diamond the quotient division is generally used instead of the division at the same time in order to make the multiplication and division digits consistently use the division multiplication later japan had a abacus called which is now the ize rongji collection of shansi village in yamagata yamagata city there were also type abacus

with the abacus spread it is also common to use japanese abacus around the world there are also improved japanese abacus in various places one of the abacus made in china is an aluminum frame plastic bead abacus the file is next to the four beads and the clearing button press the clearing button immediately put the upper bead to the upper position the lower bead is dialed to the lower position immediately clearing easy to use

the abacus is still manufactured in japan today even with the proliferation practicality and affordability of pocket electronic calculators the use of the soroban is still taught in japanese primary schools as part of mathematics primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation using visual imagery of a soroban one can arrive at the answer in the same time as or even faster than is possible with a physical instrument


the chinese abacus migrated from china to korea around ad koreans call it jupan supan or jusan
the four beads abacus was introduced to korea goryeo dynasty from the china during song dynasty later the five beads abacus abacus was introduced to korean from china during the ming dynasty




some sources mention the use of an abacus called a nepohualtzintzin in ancient aztec culture this mesoamerican abacus used a system
the word comes from nahuatl and it is formed by the ne personal or the account and tzintzin small similar elements its complete meaning was taken as counting with small similar elements by somebody its use was taught in the calmecac to the temalpouhqueh who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies from childhood

the was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord in the left part there were four beads which in the first row have unitary values and and in the right side there are three beads with values of and respectively in order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows it is enough to multiply by by each row the value of the corresponding account in the first row

altogether there were rows with beads in each one which made up beads in each this was a basic number to understand times a close relation conceived between natural phenomena the underworld and the cycles of the heavens one represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts two is the number of days of the corns cycle from its sowing to its harvest three is the number of days of a babys gestation and four completed a cycle and approximate a year days short when translated into modern computer arithmetic the amounted to the rank from to the in floating point which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision meant that no round off was allowed

the rediscovery of the was due to the mexican engineer david esparza hidalgo who in his wanderings throughout mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold jade encrustations of shell etc there have also been found very old attributed to the olmec culture and even some bracelets of maya peoplesn origin as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures

george i sanchez arithmetic in maya found another base base abacus in the peninsula that also computed calendar data this was a finger abacus on one hand and were and on the other hand and were used note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles sanchez worked with sylvanus morley a noted mayanist

the quipu of the incas was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data like advanced tally sticks but not used to perform calculations calculations were carried out using a yupana quechua languages for counting see figure which was still in use after the conquest of peru the working principle of a yupana is unknown but in an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by italian mathematician nicolino de pasquale by comparing the form of several yupanas researchers found that calculations were based using the fibonacci sequence and powers of and as place values for the different fields in the instrument using the fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum



the russian abacus the schoty plural from counting usually has a single slanted deck with ten beads on each wire except one wire usually positioned near the user with four beads for fractions older models have another wire for rubles which were minted until the russian abacus is often used vertically with each wire from left to right like lines in a book the wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides it is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right during manipulation beads are moved to the left for easy viewing the middle beads on each wire the and bead usually are of a different color from the other eight beads likewise the left bead of the thousands wire and the million wire if present may have a different color

as a simple cheap and reliable device the russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the commonwealth of independent states and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the even the invention of mechanical calculator odhner arithmometer had not replaced them in according to yakov perelman even in his times some businessmen attempting to import such devices into the russian empire were known to give up and leave in despair after being shown the work of a skilled abacus operatorarithmetic for entertainment yakov perelman page likewise the mass production of felix arithmometers since did not significantly reduce their use in the soviet union the russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of pocket calculator had started in the soviet union in today it is regarded as an archaism and replaced by the handheld calculator

the russian abacus was brought to france around by the mathematician poncelet who served in napoleons army and had been a prisoner of war in russia the abacus had fallen out of use in western europe in the century with the rise of decimal notation and algorismic methods to poncelets french contemporaries it was something new poncelet used it not for any applied purpose but as a teaching and demonstration aid the turkic peoples and the armenians people also used abacuses similar to the russian schoty it was named a coulba by the turks and a choreb by the armenians




around the world abacuses have been used in and elementary schools as an aid in teaching the numeral system and arithmetic

in western countries a bead frame similar to the russian abacus but with straight wires and a vertical frame has been common see image it is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy

the wire frame may be used either with positional notation like other abacuses thus the version may represent numbers up to or each bead may represent one unit so that eg can be represented by shifting all beads on wires and beads on the wire so numbers up to may be represented in the bead frame shown the gap between the and wire corresponding to the color change between the and the bead on each wire suggests the latter use teaching multiplication eg times may be represented by shifting beads on wires

the abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of lessons the twenty bead version referred to by its dutch language name rekenrek calculating frame is often used sometimes on a string of beads sometimes on a rigid framework



eminent physicist richard feynman was noted for expertise in mathematical calculations he wrote about an encounter in brazil with a japanese abacus expert who challenged him to speed contests between feynmans pen and paper and the abacus the abacus was much faster for addition somewhat faster for multiplication but feynman was faster at division when the abacus was used for a really difficult challenge cube roots feynman won easily but by a fluke as the number chosen at random was close to a number feynman happened to know was an exact cube allowing approximate methods to be used


by learning how to calculate with abacus one can improve ones mental calculation which becomes faster and more accurate in doing large number calculations mental abacus amc was derived from the abacus which means doing calculation including addition subtraction multiplication and division in mind with an imagined abacus it is a cognitive skill that runs through calculations with an effective algorithm people doing amc training show higher numerical memory capacity and have more effectively connected neural pathways they are able to retrieve memory to deal with complex processes to calculate the processing of amc involves both the visuospatial function and visuomotor processing which generate the visual abacus and perform the movement of the imaginary bead since the only thing needed to be remembered is the final position of beads it takes less memory and less computation time
















the binary abacus is used to explain how computers manipulate numbers the abacus shows how numbers letters and signs can be stored in a binary number on a computer or via ascii the device consists of a series of beads on parallel wires arranged in three separate rows the beads represent a switch on the computer in either an on or off position


an adapted abacus invented by tim cranmer called a cranmer abacus is still commonly used by individuals who are blindness a piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind the beads so that they do not move inadvertently this keeps the beads in place while the users feel or manipulate them they use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions multiplication division mathematics addition subtraction square root and cube root

although blind students have benefited from talking calculators the abacus is still very often taught to these students in early grades both in public schools and state schools for the blind blind students also complete mathematical assignments using a and nemeth braille a type of braille code for mathematics but large multiplication and long division problems can be long and difficult the abacus gives blind and visually impaired students a tool to compute mathematical problems that equals the speed and mathematical knowledge required by their sighted peers using pencil and paper many blind people find this number machine a very useful tool throughout life










































































































































an acid is a molecule or ion capable of donating a proton hydrogen ion a theory or alternatively capable of forming a covalent bond with an electron pair a lewis acid iupac gold book acid

the first category of acids are the proton donors or theorys in the special case of aqueous solutions proton donors form the hydronium ion and are known as theory johannes nicolaus and thomas martin lowry generalized the arrhenius theory to include solvents a or arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of

aqueous arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid acids form aqueous solutions with a sour taste can turn blue litmus red and react with base chemistry and certain metals like calcium to form salt chemistry the word acid is derived from the latin meaning sour online dictionary acid an aqueous solution of an acid has a ph less than and is colloquially also referred to as acid as in dissolved in acid while the strict definition refers only to the solution a lower ph means a higher acidity and thus a higher concentration of hydron chemistry in the solution chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be acidic

common aqueous acids include hydrochloric acid a solution of hydrogen chloride which is found in gastric acid in the stomach and activates digestive enzymes acetic acid vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid sulfuric acid used in car battery and citric acid found in citrus fruits as these examples show acids in the colloquial sense can be solutions or pure substances and can be derived from acids in the strict sense that are solids liquids or gases acid strengths and some concentrated weak acids are corrosive substance but there are exceptions such as carboranes and boric acid

the second category of acids are lewis acids and bases which form a covalent bond with an electron pair an example is boron trifluoride whose boron atom has a vacant atomic orbital which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base for example the nitrogen atom in ammonia gilbert n lewis considered this as a generalization of the definition so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly or by releasing protons into the solution which then accept electron pairs however hydrogen chloride acetic acid and most other acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not lewis acids conversely many lewis acids are not arrhenius or acids in modern terminology an acid is implicitly a acid and not a lewis acid since chemists almost always refer to a lewis acid explicitly as a lewis acid



modern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids

most acids encountered in everyday life are aqueous solutions or can be dissolved in water so the arrhenius and definitions are the most relevant

the definition is the most widely used unless otherwise specified reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton from an acid to a base

hydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions although alcohols and amines can be acids they can also function as lewis bases due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms




in svante arrhenius attributed the properties of acidity to hydrogen ions later described as ion or hydron chemistrys an arrhenius acid is a substance that when added to water increases the concentration of ions in the water note that chemists often write and refer to the hydrogen ion when describing reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus a proton does not exist alone in water it exists as the hydronium ion or other forms thus an arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water examples include molecular substances such as hydrogen chloride and acetic acid

an arrhenius base chemistry on the other hand is a substance which increases the concentration of hydroxide ions when dissolved in water this decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form molecules



due to this equilibrium any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide thus an arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration while an arrhenius base increases it

in an acidic solution the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than mole unit per liter since ph is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions acidic solutions thus have a ph of less than






while the arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions it is also quite limited in its scope in chemists johannes nicolaus and thomas martin lowry independently recognized that reactions involve the transfer of a proton a acid or simply acid is a species that donates a proton to a base theory has several advantages over arrhenius theory consider the following reactions of acetic acid the organic acid that gives vinegar its characteristic taste




both theories easily describe the first reaction acts as an arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of when dissolved in water and it acts as a acid by donating a proton to water in the second example undergoes the same transformation in this case donating a proton to ammonia but does not relate to the arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium nevertheless is both an arrhenius and a acid

theory can be used to describe reactions of molecule in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase hydrogen chloride hcl and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form ammonium chloride in aqueous solution hcl behaves as hydrochloric acid and exists as hydronium and chloride ions the following reactions illustrate the limitations of arrheniuss definition




as with the acetic acid reactions both definitions work for the first example where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the hcl solute the next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still reactions in the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia dissolved in benzene react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous hcl and combine to form the solid



a third only marginally related concept was proposed in by gilbert n lewis which includes reactions with characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer a lewis acid is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another in other words it is an electron pair acceptor reactions are proton transfer reactions while lewis reactions are electron pair transfers many lewis acids are not acids contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of chemistry

in the first reaction a fluoride gives up an lone pair to boron trifluoride to form the product tetrafluoroborate fluoride loses a pair of valence electrons because the electrons shared in the bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic atomic nucleus and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion is a lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride this reaction cannot be described in terms of theory because there is no proton transfer the second reaction can be described using either theory a proton is transferred from an unspecified acid to ammonia a alternatively ammonia acts as a lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion the species that gains the electron pair is the lewis for example the oxygen atom in gains a pair of electrons when one of the bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen depending on the context a lewis acid may also be described as an oxidizing agent or an electrophile organic acids such as acetic citric or oxalic acid are not lewis acids they dissociate in water to produce a lewis acid but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a lewis base acetate citrate or oxalate respectively for the acids mentioned this article deals mostly with acids rather than lewis acids



reactions of acids are often generalized in the form ha where ha represents the acid and is the conjugate acid this reaction is referred to as protolysis the protonated form ha of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the free acid

conjugate pairs differ by one proton and can be interconverted by the addition or removal of a proton protonation and deprotonation respectively note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as a in solution there exists an chemical equilibrium between the acid and its conjugate base the equilibrium constant k is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution brackets indicate concentration such that means the concentration of the acid dissociation constant ka is generally used in the context of reactions the numerical value of ka is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants where the reactant is the acid ha and the products are the conjugate base and

the stronger of two acids will have a higher ka than the weaker the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton because the range of possible values for ka spans many orders of magnitude a more manageable constant pka is more frequently used where pka ka stronger acids have a smaller pka than weaker acids experimentally determined pka at in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material


arrhenius acids are named according to their anions in the classical naming system the ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix according to the table following the prefix is used when the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element for example hcl has chloride as its anion so the prefix is used and the suffix makes the name take the form hydrochloric acid









































in the iupac naming system aqueous is simply added to the name of the ionic compound thus for hydrogen chloride as an acid solution the iupac name is aqueous hydrogen chloride




the strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton a strong acid is one that completely dissociates in in other words one mole unit of a strong acid ha dissolves in water yielding one mole of and one mole of the conjugate base and none of the protonated acid ha in contrast a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution examples of strong acids are hydrochloric acid hcl hydroiodic acid hi hydrobromic acid hbr perchloric acid nitric acid and sulfuric acid in water each of these essentially ionizes the stronger an acid is the more easily it loses a proton two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the chemical polarity of the bond and the size of atom a which determines the strength of the bond acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base

stronger acids have a larger acid dissociation constant ka and a more negative pka than weaker acids

sulfonic acids which are organic oxyacids are a class of strong acids a common example is toluenesulfonic acid tosylic acid unlike sulfuric acid itself sulfonic acids can be solids in fact polystyrene functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable

superacids are acids stronger than sulfuric acid examples of superacids are fluoroantimonic acid magic acid and perchloric acid superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic crystalline hydronium salts they can also quantitatively stabilize carbocations

while ka measures the strength of an acid compound the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by ph which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution the ph of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compounds ka


lewis acids have been classified in the ecw model and it has been shown that there is no one order of acid strengths the relative acceptor strength of lewis acids toward a series of bases versus other lewis acids can be illustrated by ecw modellaurence c and gal lewis basicity and affinity scales data and measurement wiley pp ibsn the plots shown in this paper used older parameters improved ec parameters are listed in ecw model it has been shown that to define the order of lewis acid strength at least two properties must be considered for pearsons qualitative hsab theory the two properties are hsab theory and strength while for quantitative ecw model the two properties are electrostatic and covalent




monoprotic acids also known as monobasic acids are those acids that are able to donate one proton per molecule during the process of dissociation chemistry sometimes called ionization as shown below symbolized by ha


common examples of monoprotic acids in mineral acids include hydrochloric acid hcl and nitric acid on the other hand for organic acids the term mainly indicates the presence of one carboxylic acid group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid examples in organic acids include formic acid hcooh acetic acid and benzoic acid



polyprotic acids also known as polybasic acids are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names such as diprotic or dibasic acid two potential protons to donate and triprotic or tribasic acid three potential protons to donate

a diprotic acid here symbolized by can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the ph each dissociation has its own dissociation constant and



the first dissociation constant is typically greater than the ie for example sulfuric acid can donate one proton to form the bisulfate anion hso for which is very then it can donate a second proton to form the sulfate anion so wherein the is intermediate strength the large for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid in a similar manner the weak unstable carbonic acid can lose one proton to form bicarbonate anion and lose a second to form carbonate anion co both ka values are small but

a triprotic acid can undergo one two or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants where




an inorganic example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid usually just called phosphoric acid all three protons can be successively lost to yield then hpo and finally po the orthophosphate ion usually just called phosphate even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent the successive ka values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged an organic compound example of a triprotic acid is citric acid which can successively lose three protons to finally form the citrate ion

although the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable all of the conjugate bases are present in solution the fractional concentration alpha for each species can be calculated for example a generic diprotic acid will generate species in solution and the fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the ph which can be converted to the or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases





a plot of these fractional concentrations against ph for given and is known as a bjerrum plot a pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general n acid that has been deprotonated i




where and the other are the dissociation constants for the acid



acid acid in beaker reacting with ammonia fumes to produce ammonium chloride white
neutralization chemistry is the reaction between an acid and a base producing a salt chemistry and neutralized for example hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide form sodium chloride and water


neutralization is the basis of titration where a ph indicator shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid it is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with ph which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction

neutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt an example is the weakly acidic ammonium chloride which is produced from the strong acid hydrogen chloride and the weak base ammonia conversely neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt eg sodium fluoride from hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxide



in order for a protonated acid to lose a proton the ph of the system must rise above the pka of the acid the decreased concentration of in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form the deprotonated form of the acid in more acidic solutions there is a high enough concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form

solutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form buffer solutions



to determine the concentration of an acid in an aqueous solution an titration is commonly performed a strong base solution with a known concentration usually naoh or koh is added to neutralize the acid solution according to the color change of the indicator with the amount of base added the titration curve of an acid titrated by a base has two axes with the base volume on the and the solutions ph value on the the ph of the solution always goes up as the base is added to the solution



for each diprotic acid titration curve from left to right there are two midpoints two equivalence points and two buffer regions


due to the successive dissociation processes there are two equivalence points in the titration curve of a diprotic acid the first equivalence point occurs when all first hydrogen ions from the first ionization are titrated in other words the amount of added equals the original amount of at the first equivalence point the second equivalence point occurs when all hydrogen ions are titrated therefore the amount of added equals twice the amount of at this time for a weak diprotic acid titrated by a strong base the second equivalence point must occur at ph above due to the hydrolysis of the resulted salts in the solution at either equivalence point adding a drop of base will cause the steepest rise of the ph value in the system


a titration curve for a diprotic acid contains two midpoints where since there are two different ka values the first midpoint occurs at and the second one occurs at each segment of the curve which contains a midpoint at its center is called the buffer region because the buffer regions consist of the acid and its conjugate base it can resist ph changes when base is added until the next equivalent points


acids exist universally in our life there are both numerous kinds of natural acid compounds with biological functions and massive synthesized acids which are used in many ways


acids are fundamental reagents in treating almost all processes in todays industry sulfuric acid a diprotic acid is the most widely used acid in industry which is also the industrial chemical in the world it is mainly used in producing fertilizer detergent batteries and dyes as well as used in processing many products such like removing impurities according to the statistics data in the annual production of sulfuric acid was around million tonnes in the world for example phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce phosphoric acid for the production of phosphate fertilizers and zinc is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid purifying the solution and electrowinning

in the chemical industry acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts for example nitric acid reacts with ammonia to produce ammonium nitrate a fertilizer additionally carboxylic acids can be esterification with alcohols to produce esters

acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as pickling metal they may be used as an electrolyte in a wet cell battery such as sulfuric acid in a car battery



tartaric acid is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids citric acid is present in oranges lemon and other citrus fruits oxalic acid is present in tomatoes spinach and especially in carambola and rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid ascorbic acid vitamin c is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla phyllanthus emblica lemon citrus fruits and guava

many acids can be found in various kinds of food as additives as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives phosphoric acid for example is a component of cola drinks acetic acid is used in life as vinegar citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles

carbonic acid is one of the most common acid additives that are widely added in soft drinks during the manufacturing process is usually pressurized to dissolve in these drinks to generate carbonic acid carbonic acid is very unstable and tends to decompose into water and at room temperature and pressure therefore when bottles or cans of these kinds of soft drinks are opened the soft drinks fizz and effervesce as bubbles come out

certain acids are used as drugs acetylsalicylic acid aspirin is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers


acids play important roles in the human body the hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of dna and rna and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes carbonic acid is important for maintenance of ph equilibrium in the body

human bodies contain a variety of organic and inorganic compounds among those dicarboxylic acids play an essential role in many biological behaviors many of those acids are amino acids which mainly serve as materials for the synthesis of proteins other weak acids serve as buffers with their conjugate bases to keep the bodys ph from undergoing large scale changes which would be harmful to cells the rest of the dicarboxylic acids also participate in the synthesis of various biologically important compounds in human bodies



acids are used as catalysts in industrial and organic for example sulfuric acid is used in very large quantities in the alkylation process to produce gasoline some acids such as sulfuric phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect dehydration reaction and condensation reactions in biochemistry many enzymes employ acid catalysis


structure of an amino biologically important molecules are acids nucleic acids which contain acidic phosphate include dna and rna nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organisms characteristics and is passed from parents to offspring dna contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of proteins which are made up of amino acid subunits cell membranes contain fatty acid esters such as phospholipids

an acid has a central carbon the or alpha and beta carbon which is covalently bonded to a carboxyl group thus they are carboxylic acids an amine group a hydrogen atom and a variable group the variable group also called the r group or side chain determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid in glycine the simplest amino acid the r group is a hydrogen atom but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens and may contain other elements such as sulfur oxygen or nitrogen with the exception of glycine naturally occurring amino acids are chirality chemistry and almost invariably occur in the chirality configuration and peptidoglycan found in some bacterial cell walls contains some acids at physiological ph typically around free amino acids exist in a charged form where the acidic carboxyl group loses a proton and the basic amine group gains a proton the entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a zwitterion with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains aspartic acid for example possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups for a net charge of at physiological ph

fatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology these contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end the cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a phospholipid bilayer a micelle of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar hydrophilic phosphate head groups membranes contain additional components some of which can participate in reactions

in humans and many other animals hydrochloric acid is a part of the gastric acid secreted within the stomach to help hydrolyze proteins and polysaccharides as well as converting the inactive pepsinogen into the digestive enzyme pepsin some organisms produce acids for for example ants produce formic acid

equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating mammalian breathing molecular oxygen gas drives cellular respiration the process by which animals release the chemical potential energy stored in food producing carbon dioxide as a byproduct oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the lungs and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of ventilation physiology for example during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored carbohydrates and fat releasing into the blood stream in aqueous solutions such as blood exists in equilibrium with carbonic acid and bicarbonate ion

it is the decrease in ph that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper expelling the excess and resupplying the cells with

acetylsalicylic acid is a carboxylic cell membranes are generally impermeable to charged or large polar molecules because of the lipophilicity fatty acyl chains comprising their interior many biologically important molecules including a number of pharmaceutical agents are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated uncharged form but not in their charged form ie as the conjugate base for this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods the charged form however is often more soluble in blood and cytosol both aqueous environments when the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral ph within the cell certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer acids that lose a proton at the intracellular ph will exist in their soluble charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target ibuprofen aspirin and penicillin are examples of drugs that are weak acids


















a sulfonic acid has the general formula where r is an organic radical








a carboxylic acid has the general formula where r is an organic radical the carboxyl group contains a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group









halogenation at alpha and beta carbon increases acid strength so that the following acids are all stronger than acetic acid







normal carboxylic acids are the direct union of a carbonyl group and a hydroxyl group in vinylogous carboxylic acids a double bond separates the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups















































asphalt also known as bitumen is a sticky black highly viscosity liquid or form of petroleum it may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product and is classed as a pitch resin before the century the term asphaltum was also used full text at internet archive archiveorg the word is derived from the ancient greek the largest natural deposit of asphalt in the world estimated to contain million tons is the pitch lake located in la brea trinidad and tobago in southwest trinidad antilles island located on the northeastern coast of venezuela within the siparia regional corporation

the primary use of asphalt is in road surface where it is used as the glue or binder mixed with construction aggregate particles to create asphalt concrete its other main uses are for bituminous waterproofing products including production of roofing felt and for sealing flat roofs

in material sciences and engineering the terms asphalt and bitumen are often used interchangeably to mean both natural and manufactured forms of the substance although there is regional variation as to which term is most common worldwide geologists tend to favor the term bitumen for the naturally occurring material for the manufactured material which is a refined residue from the distillation process of selected crude oils bitumen is the prevalent term in much of the however in american english asphalt is more commonly used to help avoid confusion the phrases liquid asphalt asphalt binder or asphalt cement are used in the us colloquially various forms of asphalt are sometimes referred to as tar as in the name of the la brea tar pits although tar is a different material

naturally occurring asphalt is sometimes specified by the term crude bitumen its viscosity is similar to that of cold molasses while the material obtained from the fractional distillation of crude oil boiling at is sometimes referred to as refined bitumen the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves of natural asphalt in the athabasca oil sands which cover an area larger than england

asphalt properties change with temperature which means that there is a specific range where viscosity permits adequate compaction by providing lubrication between particles during the compaction process low temperature prevents aggregate particles from moving and the required density is not possible to achieve computer simulations of simplified model systems are able to reproduce some of asphalts characteristic properties




the word asphalt is derived from the late middle english in turn from french asphalte based on late latin asphalton asphaltum which is the latinisation literature of the ancient greek a word meaning resin which perhaps derives from not without ie the alpha privative and sphallein to cause to fall baffle in passive err in passive be balked of the first use of asphalt by the ancients was in the nature of a cement for securing or joining together various objects and it thus seems likely that the name itself was expressive of this application specifically herodotus mentioned that bitumen was brought to babylon to build its gigantic fortification wallherodotus the histories on perseus from the greek the word passed into late latin and thence into french asphalte and english asphaltum and asphalt in french the term asphalte is used for naturally occurring limestone deposits and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the asphaltic concrete used to pave roads

the expression bitumen originated in the sanskrit words jatu meaning pitch and meaning pitch creating or pitch producing referring to coniferous or resinous trees the latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally pertaining to pitch and by others pixtumens exuding or bubbling pitch which was subsequently shortened to bitumen thence passing via french into english from the same root is derived the word cwidu mastix the german word kitt cement or mastic and the old norse word kvada


in british english bitumen is used instead of asphalt the word asphalt is instead used to refer to asphalt concrete a mixture of construction aggregate and asphalt itself also called tarmac in common parlance bitumen mixed with clay was usually called asphaltum but the term is less commonly used today

in australian english the word asphalt is used to describe a mix of construction aggregate bitumen refers to the liquid derived from the from crude oil distillation

in american english asphalt is equivalent to the british bitumen however asphalt is also commonly used as a shortened form of asphalt concrete therefore equivalent to the british asphalt or tarmac

in canadian english the word bitumen is used to refer to the vast canadian deposits of extremely heavy crude oil while asphalt is used for the oil refinery product diluted bitumen diluted with naphtha to make it flow in pipelines is known as dilbit in the canadian petroleum industry while bitumen upgrader to synthetic crude oil is known as syncrude and syncrude blended with bitumen is called synbit

bitumen is still the preferred geological term for naturally occurring deposits of the solid or form of petroleum bituminous rock is a form of sandstone impregnated with bitumen the oil sands of alberta canada are a similar material

neither of the terms asphalt or bitumen should be confused with tar or coal tars tar is the thick liquid product of the dry distillation and pyrolysis of organic hydrocarbons primarily sourced from vegetation masses whether fossilized as with coal or freshly harvested the majority of bitumen on the other hand was formed naturally when vast quantities of organic animal materials were deposited by water and buried hundreds of metres deep at the diagenesis point where the disorganized fatty hydrocarbon molecules joined together in long chains in the absence of oxygen bitumen occurs as a solid or highly viscous liquid it may even be mixed in with coal deposits bitumen and coal using the bergius process can be refined into petrols such as gasoline and bitumen may be distilled into tar not the other way around





the components of asphalt include four main classes of compounds






the naphthene aromatics and polar aromatics are typically the majority components most natural bitumens also contain organosulfur compounds resulting in an overall sulfur content of up to nickel and vanadium are found at parts per million as is typical of some petroleum

the substance is soluble in carbon disulfide it is commonly modelled as a colloid with asphaltenes as the dispersed phase and maltenes as the continuous phase it is almost impossible to separate and identify all the different molecules of asphalt because the number of molecules with different chemical structure is extremely largemuhammad abdul quddus p in ch pdf

asphalt may be confused with coal tar which is a visually similar black thermoplastic material produced by the destructive distillation of coal during the early and century when town gas was produced coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates the addition of coal tar to macadam roads led to the word tarmacadam which is now used in common parlance to refer to materials however since the when natural gas succeeded town gas asphalt has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications other examples of this confusion include the la brea tar pits and the canadian oil sands both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar pitch is another term sometimes informally used at times to refer to asphalt as in pitch lake


for economic and other reasons asphalt is sometimes sold combined with other materials often without being labeled as anything other than simply asphaltarnold terence s senior research chemist pavement materials team office of infrastructure research and development federal highway federal lab manager for the chemistry lab highway research fellow of the royal society of chemistry in the united kingdom whats in your september last modified october public roads office of research development and technology office of corporate research technology and innovation management federal highway administration us department of transportation

of particular note is the use of automotive oil residue of automotive oil recycling collected from the bottoms of vacuum distillation towers in the manufacture of asphalt reob contains various elements and compounds found in recycled engine oil additives to the original oil and materials accumulating from its circulation in the engine typically iron and copper some research has indicated a correlation between this adulteration of asphalt and pavement



the majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum nonetheless large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature naturally occurring deposits of bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient microscopic algae diatoms and other things these remains were deposited in the mud on the bottom of the ocean or lake where the organisms lived under the heat above and pressure of burial deep in the earth the remains were transformed into materials such as bitumen kerogen or petroleum

natural deposits of bitumen include lakes such as the pitch lake in trinidad and tobago and lake bermudez in venezuela natural petroleum seep occur in the la brea tar pits and in the dead sea

bitumen also occurs in unconsolidated sandstones known as oil sands in alberta canada and the similar tar sands in utah us
the canadian province of alberta has most of the worlds reserves in three huge deposits covering an area larger than england or new york state these bituminous sands contain of commercially established oil reserves giving canada the third largest oil reserves in the world although historically it was used without refining to pave roads nearly all of the output is now used as raw material for oil refinery in canada and the united states

the worlds largest deposit of natural bitumen known as the athabasca oil sands is located in the mcmurray formation of northern alberta this formation is from the early cretaceous and is composed of numerous lens geology of sand with up to oil isotopic studies show the oil deposits to be about million years old two smaller but still very large formations occur in the peace river oil sands and the cold lake oil sands to the west and southeast of the athabasca oil sands respectively of the alberta deposits only parts of the athabasca oil sands are shallow enough to be suitable for surface mining the other has to be produced by oil wells using enhanced oil recovery techniques like gravity drainage

much smaller heavy oil or bitumen deposits also occur in the uinta basin in utah us the tar sand triangle deposit for example is roughly bitumen

bitumen may occur in hydrothermal veins an example of this is within the uinta basin of utah in the us where there is a swarm of laterally and vertically extensive veins composed of a solid hydrocarbon termed gilsonite these veins formed by the polymerization and solidification of hydrocarbons that were mobilized from the deeper oil shales of the green river formation during burial and diagenesis

bitumen is similar to the organic matter in carbonaceous meteorites however detailed studies have shown these materials to be distinct the vast alberta bitumen resources are considered to have started out as living material from marine plants and animals mainly algae that died millions of years ago when an ancient ocean covered alberta they were covered by mud buried deeply over time and gently cooked into oil by geothermal heat at a temperature of due to pressure from the rising of the rocky mountains in southwestern alberta to million years ago the oil was driven northeast hundreds of kilometres and trapped into underground sand deposits left behind by ancient river beds and ocean beaches thus forming the oil sands

bitumen was used by ancient egyptians to embalming mummies the persian language word for asphalt is moom which is related to the english word mummy the egyptians primary source of bitumen was the dead sea which the ancient rome knew as palus asphaltites asphalt lake

in approximately ad dioscorides described the dead sea material as judaicum bitumen and noted other places in the region where it could be found original written c ad translated by goodyer or compiled by sprengel p p in pdf the sidon bitumen is thought to refer to material found at hasbeya in lebanon pliny the elder also refers to bitumen being found in bitumen was a valuable strategic resource it was the object of the first known battle for a hydrocarbon deposit between the seleucids and the nabateans in bc

in the ancient far east natural bitumen was slowly boiled to get rid of the higher fraction chemistry leaving a thermoplastic material of higher molecular weight that when layered on objects became quite hard upon cooling this was used to cover objects that needed waterproofing such as scabbards and other items statuettes of household deities were also cast with this type of material in japan and probably also in china

in north america archaeological recovery has indicated that bitumen was sometimes used to adhere stone projectile points to wooden shafts in canada aboriginal people used bitumen seeping out of the banks of the athabasca river and other rivers to waterproof birch bark canoes and also heated it in smudge pots to ward off mosquitoes in the summer

an edition of mechanics magazine cites an early use of asphalt in france a pamphlet dated by a certain monsieur deyrinys states that he had discovered the existence of asphaltum in large quantities in the vicinity of neufchatel and that he proposed to use it in a variety of ways principally in the construction of granaries and in protecting by means of the arches the in the city of paris from the intrusion of dirt and filth which at that time made the water unusable he expatiates also on the excellence of this material for forming level and durable terraces in palaces the notion of forming such terraces in the streets not one likely to cross the brain of a parisian of that generation

but the substance was generally neglected in france until the july revolution in the there was a surge of interest and asphalt became widely used for pavements flat roofs and the lining of cisterns and in england some use of it had been made of it for similar purposes its rise in europe was a sudden phenomenon after natural deposits were found in france at osbann the parc ain and the although it could also be made artificially note different sections of miles online work were written in different years as evidenced at the top of each page not including the heading page of each section this particular section appears to have been written in one of the earliest uses in france was the laying of about square yards of seyssel asphalt at the place de la concorde in


among the earlier uses of bitumen in the united kingdom was for etching william salmons polygraphice provides a recipe for varnish used in etching consisting of three ounces of virgin wax two ounces of mastic plant resin and one ounce of asphaltum by the fifth edition in he had included more asphaltum recipes from other sources

bitumen was thought in century britain to contain chemicals with medicinal properties extracts from bitumen were used to treat catarrh and some forms of asthma and as a remedy against worms especially the tapewormthe national cyclopaedia of useful knowledge vol iii london charles knight p


the first use of bitumen in the new world was by indigenous peoples on the west coast as early as the century the tongva people people and chumash people peoples collected the naturally occurring bitumen that seeped to the surface above underlying petroleum deposits all three groups used the substance as an adhesive it is found on many different artifacts of tools and ceremonial items for example it was used on rattle percussion instruments to adhere gourds or turtle shells to rattle handles it was also used in decorations small round shell beads were often set in asphaltum to provide decorations it was used as a sealant on baskets to make them watertight for carrying water possibly poisoning those who drank the water asphalt was used also to seal the planks on canoes

asphalt was first used to pave streets in the at first naturally occurring bituminous rock was used such as at ritchie mines in macfarlan in ritchie county west virginia from to in paving was used to pave pennsylvania avenue in washington dc in time for the celebration of the national centennial

in the era us streets were mostly unpaved and covered with dirt or gravel especially where mud or trenching often made streets difficult to pass pavements were sometimes made of diverse materials including wooden planks cobble stones or other stone blocks or bricks unpaved roads produced uneven wear and hazards for pedestrians in the late century with the rise of the popular bicycle bicycle clubs were important in pushing for more general pavement of streets advocacy for pavement increased in the early century with the rise of the automobile asphalt gradually became an ever more common method of paving st charles avenue in new orleans was paved its whole length with asphalt by

canada has the worlds largest deposit of natural bitumen in the athabasca oil sands and canadian first nations along the athabasca river had long used it to waterproof their canoes in a cree named brought a sample for trade to henry kelsey of the hudsons bay company who was the first recorded european to see it however it wasnt until that fur trader and explorer alexander mackenzie explorer saw the athabasca oil sands and said at about miles from the fork of the athabasca and clearwater rivers are some bituminous fountains into which a pole of feet long may be inserted without the least resistance

the value of the deposit was obvious from the start but the means of extracting the bitumen was not the nearest town fort mcmurray alberta was a small fur trading post other markets were far away and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving in sidney ells of the federal mines branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave feet of road in edmonton alberta other roads in alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands but it was generally not economic during the karl clark chemist of the alberta research council patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur robert c fitzsimmons built the bitumount oil separation plant which between and produced up to per day of bitumen using dr clarks method most of the bitumen was used for waterproofing roofs but other uses included fuels lubrication oils printers ink medicines and paints fireproof roofing street paving patent leather and fence post preservatives eventually fitzsimmons ran out of money and the plant was taken over by the alberta government today the bitumount plant is a provincial historic sites of alberta


bitumen was used in early photographic technology in or it was used by french scientist joseph to make the view from the window at le gras the bitumen was thinly coated onto a pewter plate which was then exposed in a camera exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently areas remained many hours of exposure in the camera were required making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography but from the to the it was in common use as a photoresist in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes museum history pages retrieved october the first photograph harry ransom center university of texas at austin retrieved october

bitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the century although widely used for a time it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting especially when mixed with the most common diluents such as linseed oil varnish and turpentine unless thoroughly diluted bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact the use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings for instance those of delacroix perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is raft of the medusa where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle




the vast majority of refined asphalt is used in construction primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications according to the requirements of the end use asphalt is produced to specification this is achieved either by refining or blending it is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately million tonnes per year approximately of all the asphalt produced is used as the binder material in asphalt concrete for roads it is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways car parks and footways typically the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse construction aggregate such as sand gravel and crushed rock with asphalt which acts as the binding agent other materials such as recycled polymers eg natural rubber tire may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended

a further of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable
the remaining of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials such as pipe coatings carpet tile backing and paint asphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures systems and components such as the following

























asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of asphalt cement and aggregates stone sand and gravel due to its highly viscous nature asphalt cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility the temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt and the aggregates but asphalt allow producers to reduce the temperature required

the weight of an asphalt pavement depends upon the construction aggregate type the asphalt and the air void content an average example in the united states is about pounds per square yard per inch of pavement thickness

when maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements such as pavement milling to remove a worn or damaged surface the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures the asphalt in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes with some of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year according to industry surveys conducted annually by the federal highway administration and the national asphalt pavement association more than of the asphalt removed each year from road surfaces during widening and resurfacing projects is reused as part of new pavements roadbeds shoulders and embankments or stockpiled for future use

asphalt concrete paving is widely used in airports around the world due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly it is widely used for runways



mastic asphalt is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt asphalt concrete in that it has a higher asphalt binder content usually around of the whole aggregate mix as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete which has only around asphalt this thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about thick


a number of technologies allow asphalt to be applied at mild temperatures the viscosity can be lowered by emulsion the asphalt by the addition of fatty amines is the content of these emulsifying agents the cationic amines enhance the binding of the asphalt to the surface of the crushed rock

asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications chipseal involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock gravel or crushed slag slurry seal is a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to asphalt several inches in depth and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled asphalt to create pavements




synthetic crude oil also known as syncrude is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in canada bituminous sands are mined using enormous ton capacity power shovels and loaded into even larger ton capacity dump trucks for movement to an upgrading facility the process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by karl clark chemist of the university of alberta during the after extraction from the sand the bitumen is fed into a upgrader which converts it into a light crude oil equivalent this synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional oil pipelines and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment by canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over per day of synthetic crude oil of which was exported to oil refineries in the united states

in alberta five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products the suncor energy upgrader near fort mcmurray alberta produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel the syncrude canada canadian natural resources and nexen upgraders near fort mcmurray produce synthetic crude and the shell scotford upgrader near edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby shell oil refinery a sixth upgrader under construction in near redwater alberta will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants



canadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as venezuelan and mexican heavy crude oil in chemical composition and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through oil pipelines to the refinery many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process bitumen directly into products such as gasoline diesel fuel and refined asphalt without any preprocessing this is particularly common in areas such as the us gulf coast where refineries were designed to process venezuelan and mexican oil and in areas such as the us midwest where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined given the choice such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline by canadian production and exports of bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over per day of which about was exported to the united states

because of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines bitumen is usually diluted with condensate in a form called dilbit or with synthetic crude oil called synbit however to meet international competition much bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen conventional crude oil synthetic crude oil and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as western canadian select this sour heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as petroleum industry in mexico or arabian dubai crude

different type of asphalt have been used blown bitumen partly oxidized with air oxygen at high temperature after distillation and harder and direct distillation bitumen softer blown bitumens like mexphalte with a high content of saturated hydrocarbons are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen with a low content of saturated hydrocarbons and a high content of aromatic n sellier r jouquet g trescinski m microbial degradation of bitumen experientia

concrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered a safer alternative by the nuclear industry and the waste management organisations


asphalt shingles and asphalt roll roofing account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption other uses include cattle sprays treatments and waterproofing for fabrics asphalt is used to make japan black a lacquer known especially for its use on iron and steel and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink and to make the color darker asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process



about tons were produced in it is obtained as the heavy ie difficult to distill fraction material with a boiling point greater than around is considered asphalt vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil such as naphtha gasoline and diesel fuel the resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications in a unit the crude asphalt is treated with either propane or butane in a supercritical fluid phase to extract the lighter molecules which are then separated further processing is possible by blowing the product namely reacting it with oxygen this step makes the product harder and more viscous

asphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around sometimes diesel oil or kerosene are mixed in before shipping to retain upon delivery these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture this mixture is often called bitumen feedstock or bfs some dump trucks route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm the backs of tippers carrying asphalt as well as some handling equipment are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release diesel oil is no longer used as a release agent due to environmental concerns



naturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from oil sands currently under development in alberta canada canada has most of the worlds supply of natural bitumen covering square kilometres an area larger than england giving it the proven oil reserves in the world the athabasca oil sands are the largest bitumen deposit in canada and the only one accessible to surface mining although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by methods because of world oil market chronology from producing bitumen became highly profitable but as a result of the decline after it became uneconomic to build new plants again by canadian crude bitumen production averaged about per day and was projected to rise to per day by the total amount of crude bitumen in alberta that could be extracted is estimated to be about which at a rate of would last about years



although uncompetitive economically asphalt can be made from renewable resources such as sugar molasses and rice corn and potato starches asphalt can also be made from waste material by fractional distillation of used motor oil which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently

asphalt binders can be made roads absorb less heat from solar radiation reducing their contribution to the urban heat island effect heat island effect from the website of the us environmental protection agency parking lots that use asphalt alternatives are called green parking lots


selenizza is a naturally occurring solid hydrocarbon bitumen found in native deposits in selenice in albania the only european asphalt mine still in use the bitumen is found in the form of veins filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction the bitumen content varies from to soluble in carbon disulphide with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point ring and ball around the insoluble matter consisting mainly of silica ore ranges from to

albanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the romans after centuries of silence the first mentions of albanian bitumen appeared only in when the frenchman henri coquand published the first geological description of the deposits of albanian bitumen in the exploitation rights were granted to the ottoman government and in they were transferred to the italian company simsa since the mine was exploited by the albanian government and from to date the management passed to a french company which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale

today the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines deep and extending over several km still remain viable selenizza is produced primarily in granular form after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine

selenizza selenice bitumi for more information about selenizza is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector it is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing it may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks bridges and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags

a assessment study of the natural selenizza compared with petroleum asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza is about half the impact of the road asphalt produced in oil refineries in terms of carbon dioxide emission


asphalt is a commonly recycled material in the construction industry the two most common recycled materials that contain asphalt are reclaimed asphalt pavement rap and reclaimed asphalt shingles ras rap is recycled at a greater rate than any other material in the united states and typically contains approximately asphalt binder asphalt shingles typically contain asphalt binder

asphalt naturally becomes stiffer over time due to oxidation evaporation exudation and physical hardening for this reason recycled asphalt is typically combined with virgin asphalt softening agents rejuvenating additives to restore its physical and chemical properties

for information on the processing and performance of rap and ras see asphalt

for information on the different types of ras and associated health and safety concerns see asphalt

for information on recycling methods used to restore pavements and roadways see road


although asphalt typically makes up only to percent by weight of the pavement mixture as the pavements binder it is also the most expensive part of the cost of the material

during asphalts early use in modern paving oil refiners gave it away however asphalt is today a highly traded commodity its prices increased substantially in the early century a us government report states


the report indicates that an average highway would include tons of asphalt which in would have cost around by this would have increased to and by to an increase of about for every mile of highway in just years




people can be exposed to asphalt in the workplace by breathing in fumes or skin absorption the national institute for occupational safety and health niosh has set a recommended exposure limit of over a period

asphalt is basically an inert material that must be heated or diluted to a point where it becomes workable for the production of materials for paving roofing and other applications in examining the potential health hazards associated with asphalt the international agency for research on cancer iarc determined that it is the application parameters predominantly temperature that affect occupational exposure and the potential bioavailable carcinogenic of the asphalt emissions in particular temperatures greater than were shown to produce a greater exposure risk than when asphalt was heated to lower temperatures such as those typically used in asphalt pavement mix production and placement iarc has classified paving asphalt fumes as a list of iarc group carcinogens possible carcinogen indicating inadequate evidence of carcinogenicity in humans

in scientists reported that asphalt currently is a significant and largely overlooked source of air pollution in urban areas especially during hot and sunny periods

in india asphalt known as shilajit found in the himalayas is consumed by people and is considered to have medicinal properties according to ayurveda

ansis members are government agencies organizations academic and international bodies and individuals in total the institute represents the interests of more than companies and organizations and million professionals worldwide


although ansi itself does not develop standards the institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations ansi accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the institutes requirements for openness balance consensus and due process

ansi also designates specific standards as american national standards or ans when the institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders

voluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers there are approximately american national standards that carry the ansi designation










in addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the united states ansi promotes the use of us standards internationally advocates us policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate

apollo was the human spaceflight that first moon landing humans on the moon commander neil armstrong and lunar module pilot buzz aldrin formed the american crew that landed the apollo lunar module lunar module eagle on july at coordinated universal time central standard time armstrong became the first person to step onto the lunar surface six hours and minutes later on july at aldrin joined him minutes later they spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft and they collected of lunar material to bring back to earth command module pilot michael collins astronaut flew the command module columbia alone in lunar orbit while they were on the moons surface armstrong and aldrin spent hours minutes on the lunar surface at a site they named tranquility base before lifting off to rejoin columbia in lunar orbit

apollo was launched by a saturn v rocket from kennedy space center on merritt island florida on july at utc and it was the fifth crewed mission of nasas apollo program the apollo apollo spacecraft had three parts a apollo command and service module cm with a cabin for the three astronauts the only part that returned to a apollo service module which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and and a apollo lunar module that had two descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit

after being injection by the saturn vs third stage the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered lunar orbit armstrong and aldrin then moved into lunar module eagle and landed in the sea of tranquility on july the astronauts used ascent stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin collins in the command module they jettisoned eagle before they performed the maneuvers that propelled columbia out of the last of its lunar orbits onto a trajectory back to earth they returned to earth and splashdown in the pacific ocean on july after more than eight days in space

armstrongs first step onto the lunar surface was broadcast on live tv to a worldwide audience he described the event as one small step for a man one giant leap for jones of the apollo lunar surface journal explains that the indefinite article a was intended whether or not it was the intention was to contrast a man an individuals action and mankind as a apollo effectively ended the space race and fulfilled a national goal proposed in by president of the united states john f kennedy before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth



in the late and early the united states was engaged in the cold war a geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union on october the soviet union launched sputnik the first satellite this surprise success fired fears and imaginations around the world it demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances and challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority this precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race president of the united states dwight d eisenhower responded to the sputnik challenge by creating the national aeronautics and space administration nasa and initiating project mercury which aimed to launch a man into earth orbit but on april soviet cosmonaut yuri gagarin became the first person in space and the first to orbit the earth nearly a month later on may alan shepard became the first american in space completing a suborbital journey after being recovered from the atlantic ocean he received a congratulatory telephone call from eisenhowers successor john f kennedy

since the soviet union had higher lift capacity launch vehicles kennedy chose from among options presented by nasa a challenge beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry so that the us and soviet union would be starting from a position of equality a crewed mission to the moon would serve this purpose

on may kennedy addressed the united states congress on urgent national needs and believe that this nation should commit itself to achieving the goal before this decade is out of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to the earth no single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind or more important for the exploration of and none will be so difficult or expensive to accomplish we propose to accelerate the development of the appropriate lunar space craft we propose to develop alternate liquid and solid fuel boosters much larger than any now being developed until certain which is superior we propose additional funds for other engine development and for unmanned which are particularly important for one purpose which this nation will never overlook the survival of the man who first makes this daring flight but in a very real sense it will not be one man going to the we make this judgment affirmatively it will be an entire nation for all of us must work to put him there speech to

on september kennedy we choose to go to the moon before a crowd of about people in the rice stadium rice university in houston texas a widely quoted refrain from the middle portion of the speech reads as follows


we choose to go to the we choose to go to the moon we choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win and the others

in spite of that the proposed program faced the opposition of many americans and was dubbed a boondoggle by norbert wiener a mathematician at the massachusetts institute of technology the effort to land a man on the moon already had a name project apollo when kennedy met with nikita khrushchev the premier of the soviet union in june he proposed making the moon landing a joint project but khrushchev did not take up the offer kennedy again proposed a joint expedition to the moon in a speech to the united nations general assembly on september the idea of a joint moon mission was abandoned after kennedys death

an early and crucial decision was choosing lunar orbit rendezvous over both direct ascent and earth orbit rendezvous a space rendezvous is an orbital maneuver in which two spacecraft navigate through space and meet up in july nasa head james e webb announced that lunar orbit rendezvous would be used and that the apollo spacecraft would have three major parts a command module cm with a cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that returned to a service module sm which supported the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and and a lunar module lm that had two descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit this design meant the spacecraft could be launched by a single saturn v rocket that was then under development

technologies and techniques required for apollo were developed by project gemini the apollo project was enabled by nasas adoption of new advances in semiconductor electronic technology including transistors mosfets in the interplanetary monitoring platform imp and silicon integrated circuit ic chips in the apollo guidance computer agc

project apollo was abruptly halted by the apollo fire on january in which astronauts gus grissom ed white astronaut and roger b chaffee died and the subsequent investigation in october apollo evaluated the command module in earth orbit and in december apollo tested it in lunar orbit in march apollo put the lunar module through its paces in earth orbit and in may apollo conducted a dress rehearsal in lunar orbit by july all was in readiness for apollo to take the final step onto the moon

the soviet union competed with the us in the space race but its early lead was lost through repeated failures in development of the rocket which was comparable to the saturn v the soviets tried to beat the us to return lunar material to the earth by means of uncrewed spacecraft on july three days before apollo launch the soviet union launched luna which reached lunar orbit before apollo during descent a malfunction caused luna to crash in mare crisium about two hours before armstrong and aldrin took off from the moons surface to begin their voyage home the nuffield radio astronomy laboratories radio telescope in england recorded transmissions from luna during its descent and these were released in july for the anniversary of apollo

















the initial crew assignment of commander neil armstrong command module pilot cmp jim lovell and lunar module pilot lmp buzz aldrin on the backup crew for was officially announced on november lovell and aldrin had previously flown together as the crew of gemini due to design and manufacturing delays in the lm and swapped prime and backup crews and armstrongs crew became the backup for based on the normal crew rotation scheme armstrong was then expected to command apollo

there would be one change michael collins astronaut the cmp on the crew began experiencing trouble with his legs doctors diagnosed the problem as a bony growth between his fifth and sixth vertebrae requiring surgery lovell took his place on the crew and when collins recovered he joined armstrongs crew as cmp in the meantime fred haise filled in as backup lmp and aldrin as backup cmp for apollo apollo was the second american mission where all the crew members had prior spaceflight experience the first being apollo the next was in

deke slayton gave armstrong the option to replace aldrin with lovell since some thought aldrin was difficult to work with armstrong had no issues working with aldrin but thought it over for a day before declining he thought lovell deserved to command his own mission eventually apollo

the apollo prime crew had none of the close cheerful camaraderie characterized by that of apollo instead they forged an amiable working relationship armstrong in particular was notoriously aloof but collins who considered himself a loner confessed to rebuffing aldrins attempts to create a more personal relationship aldrin and collins described the crew as amiable strangers armstrong did not agree with the assessment and said the crews i was on worked very well together













the backup crew consisted of lovell as commander william anders as cmp and haise as lmp anders had flown with lovell on in early he accepted a job with the national space council effective august and announced he would retire as an astronaut at that time ken mattingly was moved from the support crew into parallel training with anders as backup cmp in case apollo was delayed past its intended july launch date at which point anders would be unavailable

by the normal crew rotation in place during apollo lovell mattingly and haise were scheduled to fly on apollo after backing up for apollo later lovells crew was forced to switch places with alan shepards tentative apollo crew to give shepard more training time



during projects mercury and gemini each mission had a prime and a backup crew for apollo a third crew of astronauts was added known as the support crew the support crew maintained the flight plan checklists and mission ground rules and ensured the prime and backup crews were apprised of changes they developed procedures especially those for emergency situations so these were ready for when the prime and backup crews came to train in the simulators allowing them to concentrate on practicing and mastering them for apollo the support crew consisted of ken mattingly ronald evans astronaut and william r pogue





the capsule communicator capcom was an astronaut at the christopher c kraft jr mission control center in houston texas who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew for apollo the capcoms were charles duke ronald evans bruce mccandless ii james lovell william anders ken mattingly fred haise don l lind owen k garriott and harrison schmitt

other key personnel who played important roles in the apollo mission include the following

































the apollo mission patch was designed by collins who wanted a symbol for peaceful lunar landing by the united states at lovells suggestion he chose the bald eagle the national bird of the united states as the symbol tom wilson a simulator instructor suggested an olive branch in its beak to represent their peaceful mission collins added a lunar background with the earth in the distance the sunlight in the image was coming from the wrong the shadow should have been in the lower part of the earth instead of the left aldrin armstrong and collins decided the eagle and the moon would be in their natural colors and decided on a blue and gold border armstrong was concerned that eleven would not be understood by speakers so they went with apollo and they decided not to put their names on the patch so it would be representative of everyone who had worked toward a lunar landing

an illustrator at the manned spacecraft center msc did the artwork which was then sent off to nasa officials for approval the design was rejected bob gilruth the director of the msc felt the talons of the eagle looked too warlike after some discussion the olive branch was moved to the talons when the eisenhower dollar was released in the patch design provided the eagle for its reverse side the design was also used for the smaller susan b anthony dollar unveiled in



after the crew of apollo named their spacecraft charlie brown and snoopy assistant manager for public affairs julian scheer wrote to george m low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office at the msc to suggest the apollo crew be less flippant in naming their craft the name snowcone was used for the cm and haystack was used for the lm in both internal and external communications during early mission planning

the lm was named lunar module eagle after the motif which was featured prominently on the mission insignia at scheers suggestion the cm was named command module columbia after fiction the giant cannon that launched a spacecraft also from florida in jules vernes novel from the earth to the moon it also referred to columbia name a historical name of the united states in collins book he said columbia was in reference to christopher columbus





the astronauts had personal preference kits ppks small bags containing personal items of significance they wanted to take with them on the mission five ppks were carried on apollo three one for each astronaut were stowed on columbia before launch and two on eagle

neil armstrongs lm ppk contained a piece of wood from the wright brothers wright flyers left propeller and a piece of fabric from its wing along with a astronaut pin originally given to slayton by the widows of the crew this pin had been intended to be flown on that mission and given to slayton afterwards but following the disastrous launch pad fire and subsequent funerals the widows gave the pin to slayton armstrong took it with him on apollo




































nasas apollo site selection board announced five potential landing sites on february these were the result of two years worth of studies based on photography of the lunar surface by the five uncrewed probes of the lunar orbiter program and information about surface conditions provided by the surveyor program the best telescopes could not resolve features with the resolution project apollo required the landing site had to be close to the lunar equator to minimize the amount of propellant required clear of obstacles to minimize maneuvering and flat to simplify the task of the landing radar scientific value was not a consideration

areas that appeared promising on photographs taken on earth were often found to be totally unacceptable the original requirement that the site be free of craters had to be relaxed as no such site was found five sites were considered were in the sea of tranquility mare was in the central bay sinus and were in the ocean of storms oceanus procellarum









the requirement for the sun angle was particularly restrictive limiting the launch date to one day per month a landing just after dawn was chosen to limit the temperature extremes the astronauts would experience the apollo site selection board selected with sites as backups in the event of the launch being delayed in may apollo lunar module flew to within of and reported it was acceptable


during the first press conference after the apollo crew was announced the first question was which one of you gentlemen will be the first man to step onto the lunar slayton told the reporter it had not been decided and armstrong added that it was not based on individual desire

one of the first versions of the egress checklist had the lunar module pilot exit the spacecraft before the commander which matched what had been done on gemini missions where the commander had never performed the spacewalk reporters wrote in early that aldrin would be the first man to walk on the moon and associate administrator george mueller nasa told reporters he would be first as well aldrin heard that armstrong would be the first because armstrong was a civilian which made aldrin livid aldrin attempted to persuade other lunar module pilots he should be first but they responded cynically about what they perceived as a lobbying campaign attempting to stem interdepartmental conflict slayton told aldrin that armstrong would be first since he was the commander the decision was announced in a press conference on april

for decades aldrin believed the final decision was largely driven by the lunar modules hatch location because the astronauts had their spacesuits on and the spacecraft was so small maneuvering to exit the spacecraft was difficult the crew tried a simulation in which aldrin left the spacecraft first but he damaged the simulator while attempting to egress while this was enough for mission planners to make their decision aldrin and armstrong were left in the dark on the decision until late spring slayton told armstrong the plan was to have him leave the spacecraft first if he agreed armstrong said yes thats the way to do it

the media accused armstrong of exercising his commanders prerogative to exit the spacecraft first chris kraft revealed in his autobiography that a meeting occurred between gilruth slayton low and himself to make sure aldrin would not be the first to walk on the moon they argued that the first person to walk on the moon should be like charles lindbergh a calm and quiet person they made the decision to change the flight plan so the commander was the first to egress from the spacecraft





the ascent stage of lunar module eagle arrived at the kennedy space center on january followed by the descent stage four days later and command module columbia on january there were several differences between eagle and apollo eagle had a vhf radio antenna to facilitate communication with the astronauts during their eva on the lunar a lighter ascent more thermal protection on the landing and a package of scientific experiments known as the early apollo scientific experiments package easep the only change in the configuration of the command module was the removal of some insulation from the forward hatch the csm was mated on january and moved from the operations and checkout building to the vehicle assembly building on april

the third stage of saturn v had arrived on january followed by the second stage on february first stage on february and the saturn v instrument unit on february at on may the assembly departed the vehicle assembly building atop the bound for launch pad part of launch complex while apollo was still on its way to the moon a countdown test commenced on june and concluded on july the launch complex was floodlit on the night of july when the carried the service structure back to its parking area in the early hours of the morning the fuel tanks of the and stages were filled with liquid hydrogen fueling was completed by three hours before launch launch operations were partly automated with programs written in the atoll programming language

slayton roused the crew shortly after and they showered shaved and had the traditional breakfast of steak and eggs with slayton and the backup crew they then donned their space suits and began breathing pure oxygen at they headed out to launch complex haise entered columbia about three hours and ten minutes before launch time along with a technician he helped armstrong into the left hand couch at five minutes later collins joined him taking up his position on the right hand couch finally aldrin entered taking the center couch haise left around two hours and ten minutes before launch the closeout crew sealed the hatch and the cabin was purged and pressurized the closeout crew then left the launch complex about an hour before launch time the countdown became automated at three minutes and twenty seconds before launch time over personnel were at the consoles in the firing room






an estimated one million spectators watched the launch of apollo from the highways and beaches in the vicinity of the launch site dignitaries included the chief of staff of the united states army general united states william westmoreland four cabinet of the united states governor united states mayoralty in the united states ambassadors and congressmen vice president of the united states spiro agnew viewed the launch with former president lyndon b johnson and his wife lady bird johnson around media representatives were present about were from the united the rest came from other countries the launch was televised live in countries with an estimated viewers in the united states alone millions more around the world listened to radio broadcasts president richard nixon viewed the launch from his office in the white house with his nasa liaison officer apollo astronaut frank borman

saturn v launched apollo on july at utc eastern daylight time at seconds into the flight the launch vehicle began to roll program into its flight azimuth of full shutdown of the engines occurred about and seconds into the mission followed by separation of the and ignition of the engines the second stage engines then cut off and separated at about and allowing the first ignition of the engine a few seconds later

apollo entered a elliptic orbit at an altitude of by twelve minutes into its flight after one and a half orbits a second ignition of the engine pushed the spacecraft onto its trajectory toward the moon with the injection tli burn at utc about minutes later with collins in the left seat and at the controls the transposition docking and extraction maneuver was performed this involved separating columbia from the spent stage turning around and docking with eagle still attached to the stage after the lm was extracted the combined spacecraft headed for the moon while the rocket stage flew on a trajectory past the moon this was done to avoid the third stage colliding with the spacecraft the earth or the moon a gravity assist from passing around the moon threw it into an heliocentric orbit

on july at utc apollo passed behind the moon and fired its service propulsion engine to enter lunar orbit in the thirty orbits that followed the crew saw passing views of their landing site in the southern sea of tranquility about southwest of the crater collins crater the site was selected in part because it had been characterized as relatively flat and smooth by the automated ranger and surveyor landers and the lunar orbiter mapping spacecraft and because it was unlikely to present major landing or eva challenges it lay about southeast of the landing site and southwest of crash site





at utc on july aldrin and armstrong entered lunar module eagle and began the final preparations for lunar descent at eagle separated from columbia collins alone aboard columbia inspected eagle as it pirouetted before him to ensure the craft was not damaged and that the landing gear was correctly deployed armstrong exclaimed the eagle has

as the descent began armstrong and aldrin found themselves passing landmarks on the surface two or three seconds early and reported that they were they would land miles west of their target point eagle was traveling too fast the problem could have been mass concentration of high mass that could have altered the trajectory flight director gene kranz speculated that it could have resulted from extra air pressure in the docking tunnel or it could have been the result of eagles pirouette maneuver

five minutes into the descent burn and above the surface of the moon the apollo guidance computer lgc distracted the crew with the first of several unexpected and program alarms inside mission control center computer engineer jack garman told flight steve bales it was safe to continue the descent and this was relayed to the crew the program alarms indicated executive overflows meaning the guidance computer could not complete all its tasks in real time and had to postpone some of them margaret hamilton scientist the director of apollo flight computer programming at the mit charles stark draper laboratory later recalled



during the mission the cause was diagnosed as the rendezvous radar switch being in the wrong position causing the computer to process data from both the rendezvous and landing radars at the same time software engineer don eyles concluded in a guidance and control conference paper that the problem was due to a hardware design bug previously seen during testing of the first uncrewed lm in apollo having the rendezvous radar on so it was warmed up in case of an emergency landing abort should have been irrelevant to the computer but an electrical phasing mismatch between two parts of the rendezvous radar system could cause the stationary antenna to appear to the computer as dithering back and forth between two positions depending upon how the hardware randomly powered up the extra spurious cycle stealing as the rendezvous radar updated an involuntary counter caused the computer alarms



when armstrong again looked outside he saw that the computers landing target was in a area just north and east of a crater later determined to be west so he took control armstrong considered landing short of the boulder field so they could collect geological samples from it but could not since their horizontal velocity was too high throughout the descent aldrin called out navigation data to armstrong who was busy piloting eagle now above the surface armstrong knew their propellant supply was dwindling and was determined to land at the first possible landing site

armstrong found a clear patch of ground and maneuvered the spacecraft towards it as he got closer now above the surface he discovered his new landing site had a crater in it he cleared the crater and found another patch of level ground they were now from the surface with only seconds of propellant remaining lunar dust kicked up by the lms engine began to impair his ability to determine the spacecrafts motion some large rocks jutted out of the dust cloud and armstrong focused on them during his descent so he could determine the spacecrafts speed

a light informed aldrin that at least one of the probes hanging from eagle footpads had touched the surface a few moments before the landing and he said contact armstrong was supposed to immediately shut the engine down as the engineers suspected the pressure caused by the engines own exhaust reflecting off the lunar surface could make it explode but he forgot three seconds later eagle landed and armstrong shut the engine down aldrin immediately said okay engine stop of detent armstrong acknowledged out of detent auto aldrin continued mode auto descent engine command override off engine is in

aca was the attitude lms control stick output went to the lgc to command the reaction control system rcs jets to fire out of detent meant the stick had moved away from its centered it was like the turn indicator in a car lgc address contained the variable that indicated the lm had landed

eagle landed at utc on sunday july with of usable fuel remaining information available to the crew and mission controllers during the landing showed the lm had enough fuel for another seconds of powered flight before an abort without touchdown would have become unsafe but analysis showed that the real figure was probably closer to seconds apollo landed with less fuel than most subsequent missions and the astronauts encountered a premature low fuel warning this was later found to be the result of greater propellant slosh than expected uncovering a fuel sensor on subsequent missions extra baffles were added to the tanks to prevent this

armstrong acknowledged aldrins completion of the post landing checklist with engine arm is off before responding to the capcom charles duke with the words houston tranquility base here the eagle has landed armstrongs unrehearsed change of call sign from eagle to tranquility base emphasized to listeners that landing was complete and successful duke mispronounced his reply as he expressed the relief at mission control roger we copy you on the ground you got a bunch of guys about to turn blue were breathing again thanks a lot


two and a half hours after landing before preparations began for the eva aldrin radioed to earth

he then took eucharist privately at this time nasa was still fighting a lawsuit brought by atheist madalyn murray ohair who had objected to the apollo genesis reading demanding that their astronauts refrain from broadcasting religious activities while in space as such aldrin chose to refrain from directly mentioning taking communion on the moon aldrin was an elder at the webster texas presbyterianism and his communion kit was prepared by the pastor of the church dean woodruff webster presbyterian possesses the chalice used on the moon and commemorates the event each year on the sunday closest to july the schedule for the mission called for the astronauts to follow the landing with a sleep period but they chose to begin preparations for the eva early thinking they would be unable to sleep





preparations for neil armstrong and buzz aldrin to walk on the moon began at these took longer than three and a half hours instead of two during training on earth everything required had been neatly laid out in advance but on the moon the cabin contained a large number of other items as well such as checklists food packets and tools six hours and minutes after landing armstrong and aldrin were ready to go outside and eagle was depressurized

hatch was opened at armstrong initially had some difficulties squeezing through the hatch with his primary life support system plss some of the highest heart rates recorded from apollo astronauts occurred during lm egress and ingress at armstrong began his descent to the lunar surface the remote control unit on his chest kept him from seeing his feet climbing down the ladder armstrong pulled a to deploy the modular equipment stowage assembly mesa folded against eagle side and activate the tv camera

apollo used television tv incompatible with broadcast tv so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional tv camera viewed this monitor significantly reducing the quality of the picture the signal was received at goldstone deep space communications complex in the united states but with better fidelity by honeysuckle creek tracking station near canberra in australia minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive parkes observatory in australia despite some technical and weather difficulties ghostly black and white images of the first lunar eva were received and broadcast to at least people on earth copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available but apollo missing tapes were likely destroyed during routine magnetic tape at nasa



after describing the surface dust as very and almost like a powder at six and a half hours after landing armstrong stepped off eagle footpad and declared thats one small step for a man one giant leap for mankind includes the a article as intended

armstrong intended to say thats one small step for a man but the word a is not audible in the transmission and thus was not initially reported by most observers of the live broadcast when later asked about his quote armstrong said he believed he said for a man and subsequent printed versions of the quote included the a in square brackets one explanation for the absence may be that his accent caused him to slur the words for a another is the intermittent nature of the audio and video links to earth partly because of storms near parkes observatory more recent digital analysis of the tape claims to reveal the a may have been spoken but obscured by static other analysis points to the claims of static and slurring as fabrication and that armstrong himself later admitted to misspeaking the line

about seven minutes after stepping onto the moons surface armstrong collected a contingency soil sample using a sample bag on a stick he then folded the bag and tucked it into a pocket on his right thigh this was to guarantee there would be some lunar soil brought back in case an emergency required the astronauts to abandon the eva and return to the lm twelve minutes after the sample was collected he removed the tv camera from the mesa and made a panoramic sweep then mounted it on a tripod the tv camera cable remained partly coiled and presented a tripping hazard throughout the eva still photography was accomplished with a hasselblad camera which could be operated hand held or mounted on armstrongs aldrin joined armstrong on the surface he described the view with the simple phrase magnificent desolation

armstrong said moving in the gravitation of the moon of earths was even perhaps easier than the its absolutely no trouble to walk around aldrin joined him on the surface and tested methods for moving around including kangaroo hops the plss backpack created a tendency to tip backward but neither astronaut had serious problems maintaining balance loping became the preferred method of movement the astronauts reported that they needed to plan their movements six or seven steps ahead the fine soil was quite slippery aldrin remarked that moving from sunlight into eagle shadow produced no temperature change inside the suit but the helmet was warmer in sunlight so he felt cooler in shadow the mesa failed to provide a stable work platform and was in shadow slowing work somewhat as they worked the moonwalkers kicked up gray dust which soiled the outer part of their suits


the astronauts planted the lunar flag assembly containing a flag of the united states on the lunar surface in clear view of the tv camera aldrin remembered of all the jobs i had to do on the moon the one i wanted to go the smoothest was the flag raising but the astronauts struggled with the telescoping rod and could only jam the pole about into the hard lunar surface aldrin was afraid it might topple in front of tv viewers but he gave a crisp west point salute before aldrin could take a photo of armstrong with the flag president richard nixon spoke to them through a transmission which nixon called the most historic phone call ever made from the white house nixon originally had a long speech prepared to read during the phone call but frank borman who was at the white house as a nasa liaison during apollo convinced nixon to keep his words brief

armstrong thank you mr president its a great honor and privilege for us to be here representing not only the united states but men of peace of all nations and with interest and a curiosity and men with a vision for the future its an honor for us to be able to participate here


they deployed the early apollo scientific experiments package which included a passive seismic experiment package used to measure moonquakes and a the moon array used for the lunar laser ranging experiment then armstrong walked from the lm to snap photos at the rim of little west lunar crater while aldrin collected two core samples he used the geologists hammer to pound in the only time the hammer was used on apollo was unable to penetrate more than deep the astronauts then collected rock samples using scoops and tongs on extension handles many of the surface activities took longer than expected so they had to stop documenting sample collection halfway through the allotted minutes aldrin shoveled of soil into the box of rocks in order to pack them in tightly two types of rocks were found in the geological samples basalt and breccia three new minerals were discovered in the rock samples collected by the astronauts armalcolite tranquillityite and pyroxferroite armalcolite was named after armstrong aldrin and collins all have subsequently been found on earth


while on the surface armstrong uncovered a lunar plaque mounted on the lm ladder bearing two drawings of earth of the western and eastern hemispheres an inscription and signatures of the astronauts and president nixon the inscription read

at the behest of the nixon administration to add a reference to god nasa included the vague date as a reason to include ad which stands for anno domini in the year of our lord although it should have been placed before the year not after

mission control used a coded phrase to warn armstrong his metabolic rates were high and that he should slow down he was moving rapidly from task to task as time ran out as metabolic rates remained generally lower than expected for both astronauts throughout the walk mission control granted the astronauts a extension in a interview armstrong explained that nasa limited the first moonwalks time and distance because there was no empirical proof of how much cooling water the astronauts plss backpacks would consume to handle their body heat generation while working on the moon



aldrin entered eagle first with some difficulty the astronauts lifted film and two sample boxes containing of lunar surface material to the lm hatch using a flat cable pulley device called the lunar equipment conveyor lec this proved to be an inefficient tool and later missions preferred to carry equipment and samples up to the lm by hand armstrong reminded aldrin of a bag of memorial items in his sleeve pocket and aldrin tossed the bag down armstrong then jumped onto the ladders third rung and climbed into the lm after transferring to lm life support the explorers lightened the ascent stage for the return to lunar orbit by tossing out their plss backpacks lunar overshoes an empty hasselblad camera and other equipment the hatch was closed again at they then pressurized the lm and settled down to sleep



presidential speech writer william safire had prepared an in event of moon disaster announcement for nixon to read in the event the apollo astronauts were stranded on the moon scanned copy of the in event of moon disaster memo the remarks were in a memo from safire to nixons white house chief of staff h r haldeman in which safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster according to the plan mission control would close down communications with the lm and a clergyman would commend their souls to the deepest of the deep in a public ritual likened to burial at sea the last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to rupert brookes first world war poem the soldier poem

while moving inside the cabin aldrin accidentally damaged the circuit breaker that would arm the main engine for lift off from the moon there was a concern this would prevent firing the engine stranding them on the moon a marker pen was sufficient to activate the switch

after more than hours on the lunar surface in addition to the scientific instruments the astronauts left behind an apollo mission patch in memory of b chaffee gus grissom and ed white astronaut who died when their command module caught fire during a test in january two memorial medals of soviet cosmonauts vladimir komarov and yuri gagarin who died in and a memorial bag containing a gold replica of an olive branch as a traditional symbol of and a silicon message disk carrying the apollo goodwill messages by presidents eisenhower kennedy johnson and nixon along with messages from leaders of countries around the world the disk also carries a listing of the leadership of the us congress a listing of members of the four committees of the house and senate responsible for the nasa legislation and the names of nasas past and top management


after about seven hours of rest the crew was awakened by houston to prepare for the return flight two and a half hours later at utc they lifted off in eagle ascent stage to rejoin collins aboard columbia in lunar orbit film taken from the lm ascent stage upon liftoff from the moon reveals the american flag planted some from the descent stage whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine aldrin looked up in time to witness the flag topple the ascent stage of the lm i was concentrating on the computers and neil was studying the attitude indicator but i looked up long enough to see the flag fall over subsequent apollo missions planted their flags farther from the lm



during his day flying solo around the moon collins never felt lonely although it has been said not since adam has any human known such solitude collins felt very much a part of the mission in his autobiography he wrote this venture has been structured for three men and i consider my third to be as necessary as either of the other two in the minutes of each orbit when he was out of radio contact with the earth while columbia passed round the far side of the moon the feeling he reported was not fear or loneliness but rather awareness anticipation satisfaction confidence almost exultation

one of collins first tasks was to identify the lunar module on the ground to give collins an idea where to look mission control radioed that they believed the lunar module landed about off target each time he passed over the suspected lunar landing site he tried in vain to find the module on his first orbits on the back side of the moon collins performed maintenance activities such as dumping excess water produced by the fuel cells and preparing the cabin for armstrong and aldrin to return

just before he reached the dark side on the third orbit mission control informed collins there was a problem with the temperature of the coolant if it became too cold parts of columbia might freeze mission control advised him to assume manual control and implement environmental control system malfunction procedure instead collins flicked the switch on the system from automatic to manual and back to automatic again and carried on with normal housekeeping chores while keeping an eye on the temperature when columbia came back around to the near side of the moon again he was able to report that the problem had been resolved for the next couple of orbits he described his time on the back side of the moon as relaxing after aldrin and armstrong completed their eva collins slept so he could be rested for the rendezvous while the flight plan called for eagle to meet up with columbia collins was prepared for a contingency in which he would fly columbia down to meet eagle





eagle rendezvoused with columbia at utc on july and the two docked at ascent stage was jettisoned into lunar orbit at just before the apollo flight it was noted that eagle was still likely to be orbiting the moon later nasa reports mentioned that eagle orbit had decayed resulting in it impacting in an uncertain location on the lunar surface

on july the last night before splashdown the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which collins commented the saturn v rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery every piece of which worked we have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly all this is possible only through the blood sweat and tears of a number of all you see is the three of us but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others and to all of those i would like to say thank you very
aldrin added has been far more than three men on a mission to the more still than the efforts of a government and industry more even than the efforts of one nation we feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the personally in reflecting on the events of the past several days a verse from psalms comes to mind when i consider the heavens the work of thy fingers the moon and the stars which thou hast what is man that thou art mindful of

armstrong concluded responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this next with the american people who have through their will indicated their next with four administrations and their congresses for implementing that and then with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft the saturn the columbia the eagle and the little extravehicular mobility unit the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface we would like to give special thanks to all those americans who built the who did the construction design the tests and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft to those people tonight we give a special thank you and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight god bless you good night from apollo

on the return to earth a bearing at the guam tracking station failed potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the earth return a regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director charles force had his son greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease greg was later thanked by armstrong





the aircraft carrier under the command of captain united states carl j seiberlich was selected as the primary recovery ship prs for apollo on june replacing its sister ship the landing platform helicopter which had recovered apollo on may hornet was then at her home port of long beach california on reaching pearl harbor on july hornet embarkation the sikorsky sea king helicopters of a unit which specialized in recovery of apollo spacecraft specialized divers of underwater demolition team detachment apollo a nasa recovery team and about media representatives to make room most of hornets air wing was left behind in long beach special recovery equipment was also loaded including a boilerplate spaceflight command module used for training

on july with apollo still on the launch pad hornet departed pearl harbor for the recovery area in the central pacific in the vicinity of a presidential party consisting of nixon borman united states secretary of state william p rogers and national security advisor united states henry kissinger flew to johnston atoll on air force one then to the command ship in marine one after a night on board they would fly to hornet in marine one for a few hours of ceremonies on arrival aboard hornet the party was greeted by the united states pacific command admiral united states john s mccain jr and nasa administrator thomas o paine who flew to hornet from pago pago in one of hornets carrier onboard delivery aircraft

weather satellites were not yet common but us air force captain united states hank brandli had access to top secret spy satellite images he realized that a storm front was headed for the apollo recovery area poor visibility which could make locating the capsule difficult and strong winds which would have ripped their parachutes to shreds according to brandli posed a serious threat to the safety of the mission brandli alerted navy captain willard s houston jr the commander of the joint typhoon warning center at pearl harbor who had the required security clearance on their recommendation rear admiral united states donald c davis commander of manned spaceflight recovery forces pacific advised nasa to change the recovery area each man risking their careers a new location was selected northeast

this altered the flight plan a different sequence of computer programs was used one never before attempted in a conventional entry was followed by for a and were employed to handle the exit and entry parts of the skip in this case because they were extending the but not actually skipping out was not invoked and instead led directly to the crew were also warned they would not be in a attitude when they entered the first programs acceleration subjected the astronauts to the second to

before dawn on july hornet launched four sea king helicopters and three grumman tracers two of the were designated as air boss while the third acted as a communications relay aircraft two of the sea kings carried divers and recovery equipment the third carried photographic equipment and the fourth carried the decontamination swimmer and the flight surgeon at utc local time drogue parachutes were deployed this was observed by the helicopters seven minutes later columbia struck the water forcefully east of wake island south of johnston atoll and from hornet at with seas and winds at from the east were reported under broken clouds at with visibility of at the recovery site reconnaissance aircraft flying to the original splashdown location reported the conditions brandli and houston had predicted

during splashdown columbia landed upside down but was righted within ten minutes by flotation bags activated by the astronauts a diver from the navy helicopter hovering above attached a sea anchor to prevent it from drifting more divers attached flotation collars to stabilize the module and positioned rafts for astronaut extraction











the divers then passed biological isolation garments bigs to the astronauts and assisted them into the life raft the possibility of bringing back pathogens from the lunar surface was considered remote but nasa took precautions at the recovery site the astronauts were rubbed down with a sodium hypochlorite solution and columbia wiped with betadine to remove any lunar dust that might be present the astronauts were winched on board the recovery helicopter bigs were worn until they reached isolation facilities on board hornet the raft containing decontamination materials was intentionally sunk

after touchdown on hornet at utc the helicopter was lowered by the elevator into the hangar bay where the astronauts walked the to the mobile quarantine facility mqf where they would begin the portion of their days of quarantine this practice would continue for two more apollo missions apollo and apollo before the moon was proven to be barren of life and the quarantine process dropped nixon welcomed the astronauts back to earth he told them as a result of what youve done the world has never been closer together before

after nixon departed hornet was brought alongside the columbia which was lifted aboard by the ships crane placed on a dolly trailer and moved next to the mqf it was then attached to the mqf with a flexible tunnel allowing the lunar samples film data tapes and other items to be removed hornet returned to pearl harbor where the mqf was loaded onto a lockheed starlifter and airlifted to the manned spacecraft center the astronauts arrived at the lunar receiving laboratory at utc on july columbia was taken to ford island for deactivation and its pyrotechnics made safe it was then taken to hickham air force base from whence it was flown to houston in a douglas cargomaster reaching the lunar receiving laboratory on july

in accordance with the exposure law a set of regulations promulgated by nasa on july to codify its quarantine exposure fed reg july codified at cfr pt the astronauts continued in quarantine after three weeks in confinement first in the apollo spacecraft then in their trailer on hornet and finally in the lunar receiving laboratory the astronauts were given a clean bill of health on august the interagency committee on back contamination met in atlanta and lifted the quarantine on the astronauts on those who had joined them in quarantine nasa physician william carpentier and mqf project engineer john hirasaki and on columbia itself loose equipment from the spacecraft remained in isolation until the lunar samples were released for study





on august the three astronauts rode in parades in their honor in new york and chicago with an estimated six million attendees on the same evening in los angeles there was an official state dinner to celebrate the flight attended by members of congress governors the chief justice of the united states and ambassadors from nations at the century plaza hotel nixon and agnew honored each astronaut with a presentation of the presidential medal of freedom

the three astronauts spoke before a joint session of the united states congress on september they presented two us flags one to the united states house of representatives and the other to the united states senate that they had carried with them to the surface of the moon the flag of american samoa on apollo is on display at the jean p haydon museum in pago pago the capital of american samoa

this celebration began a world tour that brought the astronauts to foreign countries and included visits with the leaders of many countries the crew toured from september to november many nations honored the first human moon landing with special features in magazines or by issuing apollo commemorative postage stamps or coins





humans walking on the moon and returning safely to earth accomplished kennedys goal set eight years earlier in mission control during the apollo landing kennedys speech flashed on the screen followed by the words task accomplished july the success of apollo demonstrated the united states technological and with the success of apollo america had won the space race

new phrases permeated into the english language if they can send a man to the moon why cant became a common saying following apollo armstrongs words on the lunar surface also spun off various parodies

while most people celebrated the accomplishment disenfranchised americans saw it as a symbol of the divide in america evidenced by protesters outside of kennedy space center the day before apollo launched this is not to say they were not awed by it ralph abernathy leading a protest march was so captivated by the spectacle of the apollo launch that he forgot what he was going to say racial and financial inequalities frustrated citizens who wondered why money spent on the apollo program was not spent taking care of humans on earth a poem by gil called whitey on the moon illustrated the racial inequality in the united states that was highlighted by the space race the poem starts with










twenty percent of the worlds population watched humans walk on the moon for the first time while apollo sparked the interest of the world the apollo missions did not hold the interest of the nation one possible explanation was the shift in complexity landing someone on the moon was an easy goal to lunar geology was too abstract for the average person another is that kennedys goal of landing humans on the moon had already been accomplished a objective helped project apollo accomplish its goal but after it was completed it was hard to justify continuing the lunar missions

while most americans were proud of their nations achievements in space exploration only once during the late did the gallup poll indicate that a majority of americans favored doing more in space as opposed to doing less by percent of those polled favored cutting spending on space exploration the space race had ended and cold war tensions were easing as the us and soviet union entered the era of this was also a time when inflation was rising which put pressure on the government to reduce spending what saved the space program was that it was one of the few government programs that had achieved something great drastic cuts warned caspar weinberger the deputy director of the office of management and budget might send a signal that our best years are behind us

after the apollo mission officials from the soviet union said landing humans on the moon was dangerous and unnecessary at the time the soviet union was attempting to retrieve lunar samples robotically the soviets publicly denied there was a race to the moon and indicated they were not making an attempt mstislav keldysh said in july we are concentrating wholly on the creation of large satellite systems it was revealed in that the soviets had tried to send people to the moon but were unable due to technological difficulties the publics reaction in the soviet union was mixed the soviet government limited the release of information about the lunar landing which affected the reaction a portion of the populace did not give it any attention and another portion was angered by it

the apollo landing is referenced in the songs armstrong aldrin and collins by the byrds on the album ballad of easy rider album and coon on the moon by howlin wolf on the album the back door wolf





the command module columbia went on a tour of the united states visiting state capitals the washington dc and anchorage alaska in it was transferred to the smithsonian institution and was displayed at the national air and space museum nasm in washington dc it was in the central milestones of flight exhibition hall in front of the jefferson drive entrance sharing the main hall with other pioneering flight vehicles such as the wright flyer spirit of st louis bell north american and friendship

columbia was moved in to the nasm mary baker engen restoration hangar at the steven f center in chantilly virginia to be readied for a tour titled destination moon the apollo mission this included space center houston from october to march the saint louis science center from april to september the senator john heinz history center in pittsburgh from september to february and its last location at museum of flight in seattle from march to september continued renovations at the smithsonian allowed time for an additional stop for the capsule and it was moved to the cincinnati museum center the ribbon cutting ceremony was on september

for years armstrongs and aldrins space suits were displayed in the museums apollo to the moon exhibit until it permanently closed on december to be replaced by a new gallery which was scheduled to open in a special display of armstrongs suit was unveiled for the anniversary of apollo in july the quarantine trailer the flotation collar and the flotation bags are in the smithsonians steven f center annex near washington dulles international airport in chantilly virginia where they are on display along with a test lunar module

the descent stage of the lm eagle remains on the moon in the lunar reconnaissance orbiter lro imaged the various apollo landing sites on the surface of the moon for the first time with sufficient resolution to see the descent stages of the lunar modules scientific instruments and foot trails made by the astronauts the remains of the ascent stage lie at an unknown location on the lunar surface after being abandoned and impacting the moon the location is uncertain because eagle ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time








in march a team of specialists financed by amazoncom founder jeff bezos located the rocketdyne from the stage that launched apollo into space they were found on the atlantic seabed using advanced sonar scanning his team brought parts of two of the five engines to the surface in july a conservator discovered a serial number under the rust on one of the engines raised from the atlantic which nasa confirmed was from apollo the third stage which performed apollo injection remains in a solar orbit near to that of earth





the main repository for the apollo moon rocks is the lunar sample laboratory facility at the lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas for safekeeping there is also a smaller collection stored at white sands test facility near las cruces new mexico most of the rocks are stored in nitrogen to keep them free of moisture they are handled only indirectly using special tools over research laboratories around the world conduct studies of the samples and approximately samples are prepared and sent to investigators every year

in november nixon asked nasa to make up about presentation apollo lunar sample displays for nations the fifty states of the united states and its possessions and the united nations each display included moon dust from apollo the particles were four small pieces of moon soil weighing about and were enveloped in a clear acrylic button about as big as a half dollar united states coin this acrylic button magnified the grains of lunar dust the apollo lunar sample displays were given out as goodwill gifts by nixon in magazine march pp



the passive seismic experiment ran until the command uplink failed on august the downlink failed on december the lunar laser ranging experiment remains operational



armstrongs hasselblad camera was thought to be lost or left on the moon surface in after armstrong died in his widow contacted the national air and space museum to inform them she had found a white cloth bag in one of armstrongs closets the bag contained a forgotten camera that had been used to capture images of the first moon landing the camera is currently on display at the national air and space museum









on july life magazine released a photo gallery of previously unpublished photos of the astronauts taken by life photographer ralph morse prior to the apollo launch from july to nasa streamed the original mission audio on its website in real time years to the minute after the events occurred it is in the process of restoring the video footage and has released a preview of key moments in july voice recordings and film footage shot in mission control during the apollo powered descent and landing was and released for the first time the john f kennedy presidential library and museum set up an adobe flash website that rebroadcasts the transmissions of apollo from launch to landing on the moon

on july armstrong aldrin and collins met with us president barack obama at the white house we expect that there is as we speak another generation of kids out there who are looking up at the sky and are going to be the next armstrong collins and aldrin obama said we want to make sure that nasa is going to be there for them when they want to take their journey on august an act of congress awarded the three astronauts a congressional gold medal the highest civilian award in the united states the bill was sponsored by florida senator bill nelson politician and florida representative alan grayson

a group of british scientists interviewed as part of the anniversary events reflected on the significance of the moon landing







on june congressman bill posey introduced resolution hr to the session of the united states house of representatives directing the united states mint to design and sell commemorative coins in gold silver and clad for the anniversary of the apollo mission on january the mint released the apollo fiftieth anniversary commemorative coins to the public on its website

apollo was the first crewed spacecraft to leave low earth orbit and also the first human spaceflight to reach another astronomical object namely the moon which the crew orbited without landing and then departed safely back to earth these three borman jim lovell and bill the first humans to witness and photograph an earthrise

apollo launched on december and was the second crewed spaceflight mission flown in the united states apollo space program after apollo which stayed in earth orbit was the third flight and the first crewed launch of the saturn v rocket and was the first human spaceflight from the kennedy space center located adjacent to cape canaveral space force station in florida

originally planned as the second crewed apollo lunar module and apollo command and service module test to be flown in an elliptical medium earth orbit in early the mission profile was changed in august to a more ambitious lunar orbital flight to be flown in december as the lunar module was not yet ready to make its first flight astronaut jim mcdivitts crew who were training to fly the first lunar module flight in low earth orbit became the crew for the apollo mission and bormans crew were moved to the mission this left bormans crew with two to three months less training and preparation time than originally planned and replaced the planned lunar module training with translunar navigation training

apollo took hours almost three days to travel the distance to the moon the crew orbited the moon ten times over the course of twenty hours during which they made a christmas eve apollo tv camera in which they apollo genesis reading the book of genesis at the time the broadcast was the most watched tv program ever successful mission paved the way for apollo to fulfill us president john f kennedys goal of landing a man on the moon before the end of the the astronauts returned to earth on december when their spacecraft splashed down in the northern pacific ocean the crew members were named time magazines time person of the year for upon their return



in the late and early the united states was engaged in the cold war a geopolitical rivalry with the soviet union on october the soviet union launched sputnik the first satellite this unexpected success stoked fears and imaginations around the world it not only demonstrated that the soviet union had the capability to deliver nuclear weapons over intercontinental distances it challenged american claims of military economic and technological superiority the launch precipitated the sputnik crisis and triggered the space race

president of the united states john f kennedy believed that not only was it in the national interest of the united states to be superior to other nations but that the perception of american power was at least as important as the actuality it was therefore intolerable to him for the soviet union to be more advanced in the field of space exploration he was determined that the united states should compete and sought a challenge that maximized its chances of winning

the soviet union had carrier rockets which meant kennedy needed to choose a goal that was beyond the capacity of the existing generation of rocketry one where the us and soviet union would be starting from a position of spectacular even if it could not be justified on military economic or scientific grounds after consulting with his experts and advisors he chose such a project to land a man on the moon and return him to the earth this project already had a name project apollo

an early and crucial decision was the adoption of lunar orbit rendezvous under which a specialized spacecraft would land on the lunar surface the apollo spacecraft therefore had three primary components a apollo command and service module cm cm with a cabin for the three astronauts and the only part that would return to a service module sm to provide the command module with propulsion electrical power oxygen and and a lunar module lm which comprised a descent stage for landing on the moon and an ascent stage to return the astronauts to lunar orbit this configuration could be launched by the saturn v rocket that was then under development


















the initial crew assignment of frank borman as commander michael collins astronaut as command module pilot cmp and william anders as lunar module pilot lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced on november collins was replaced by jim lovell in july after suffering a intervertebral disc spinal disc herniation that required surgery to repair this crew was unique among shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew lovell had flown twice before on gemini and gemini this would also be the first case of a commander of a previous mission lovell gemini xii flying as a this was also the first mission to reunite crewmates from a previous mission lovell and borman gemini vii
















the backup crew assignment of neil armstrong as commander lovell as cmp and buzz aldrin as lmp for the third crewed apollo flight was officially announced at the same time as the prime crew when lovell was reassigned to the prime crew aldrin was moved to cmp and fred haise was brought in as backup lmp armstrong would later command with aldrin as lmp and collins as cmp haise served on the backup crew of as lmp and flew on apollo as lmp



during projects mercury and gemini each mission had a prime and a backup crew for apollo a third crew of astronauts was added known as the support crew the support crew maintained the flight plan checklists and mission ground rules and ensured that the prime and backup crews were apprised of any changes the support crew developed procedures in the simulators especially those for emergency situations so that the prime and backup crews could practice and master them in their simulator training for the support crew consisted of ken mattingly vance brand and gerald p carr

the capsule communicator capcom was an astronaut at the christopher c kraft jr mission control center in houston texas who was the only person who communicated directly with the flight crew for the capcoms were michael collins gerald carr ken mattingly neil armstrong buzz aldrin vance brand and fred haise

the mission control teams rotated in three shifts each led by a flight director the directors for were clifford e charlesworth green team glynn lunney black team and milton windler maroon team





the triangular shape of the insignia refers to the shape of the apollo cm it shows a red looping around the earth and moon to reflect both the mission number and the circumlunar nature of the mission on the bottom of are the names of the three astronauts the initial design of the insignia was developed by jim lovell who reportedly sketched it while riding in the back seat of a northrop talon flight from california to houston shortly after learning of as a mission

the crew wanted to name their spacecraft but nasa did not allow it the crew would have likely chosen columbiad the name of the giant cannon that launches a space vehicle in jules vernes novel from the earth to the moon the cm was named columbia in part for that reason






on september nasa adopted a plan for apollo missions with the final step being a moon landing apollo and apollo were a missions tests of the saturn v launch vehicle using an uncrewed block i production model of the command and service module csm in earth orbit apollo was a b mission a test of the lm in earth orbit scheduled for october would be a c mission a crewed flight of the csm further missions depended on the readiness of the lm it had been decided as early as may that there would be at least four additional missions was planned as the d mission a test of the lm in a low earth orbit in december by james mcdivitt david scott and rusty schweickart while bormans crew would fly the e mission a more rigorous lm test in an elliptical medium earth orbit as in early the f mission would test the csm and lm in lunar orbit and the g mission would be the finale the moon landing


production of the lm fell behind schedule and when arrived at the kennedy space center ksc in june more than a hundred significant defects were discovered leading bob gilruth the director of the manned spacecraft center msc and others to conclude that there was no prospect of being ready to fly in indeed it was possible that delivery would slip to february or march following the original plan would have meant delaying the d and subsequent missions and endangering the programs goal of a lunar landing before the end of george low the manager of the apollo spacecraft program office proposed a solution in august to keep the program on track despite the lm delay since the next csm designated as would be ready three months before a mission could be flown in december instead of repeating the c mission flight of this csm could be sent all the way to the moon with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit and returning to earth the new mission would also allow nasa to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have had to wait until apollo the scheduled f mission this also meant that the medium earth orbit e mission could be dispensed with the net result was that only the d mission had to be delayed and the plan for lunar landing in could remain on timeline

on august low discussed the idea with gilruth flight director chris kraft and the director of flight crew operations donald slayton they then flew to the marshall space flight center msfc in huntsville alabama where they met with ksc director kurt debus apollo program director samuel c phillips rocco petrone and wernher von braun kraft considered the proposal feasible from a flight control debus and petrone agreed that the next saturn v could be made ready by december and von braun was confident the pogo oscillation problems that had afflicted had been fixed almost every senior manager at nasa agreed with this new mission citing confidence in both the hardware and the personnel along with the potential for a circumlunar flight providing a significant morale boost the only person who needed some convincing was james e webb the nasa administrator backed by the full support of his agency webb authorized the mission was officially changed from a d mission to a mission

with the change in mission for apollo slayton asked mcdivitt if he still wanted to fly it mcdivitt turned it his crew had spent a great deal of time preparing to test the lm and that was what he still wanted to do slayton then decided to swap the prime and backup crews of the dand emissions this swap also meant a swap of spacecraft requiring bormans crew to use while mcdivitts crew would use since could not be made ready by december david scott was not happy about giving up the testing of which he had closely supervised for although the two were almost identical and anders was less than enthusiastic about being an lmp on a flight with no lm instead in order that the spacecraft would have the correct weight and balance would carry lm test article a boilerplate model of

added pressure on the apollo program to make its landing goal was provided by the soviet unions zond mission which flew some living creatures including russian tortoises in a cislunar loop around the moon and returned them to earth on september there was speculation within nasa and the press that they might be preparing to launch on a similar zond missions before the end of


the apollo crew now living in the crew quarters at kennedy space center received a visit from charles lindbergh and his wife anne morrow lindbergh the night before the launch they talked about how before his spirit of st louis lindbergh had used a piece of string to measure the distance from new york city to paris on a globe and from that calculated the fuel needed for the flight the total he had carried was a tenth of the amount that the saturn v would burn every second the next day the lindberghs watched the launch of from a nearby dune



the saturn v rocket used by was designated or the model of the saturnv rocket to be used in the as program when it was erected in the vehicle assembly building on december it was thought that the rocket would be used for an uncrewed test flight carrying a boilerplate spaceflight command and service module had suffered several major problems during its april flight including severe pogo oscillation during its first stage two engine failures and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit without assurances that these problems had been rectified nasa administrators could not justify risking a crewed mission until additional uncrewed test flights proved the saturn v was ready

teams from the msfc went to work on the problems of primary concern was the pogo oscillation which would not only hamper engine performance but could exert significant on a crew a task force of contractors nasa agency representatives and msfc researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket a system that used helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed


of equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two when an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two it had accidentally shut down engine threes liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection as a result engine three failed within one second of engine twos shutdown further investigation revealed the same problem for the faulty igniter line the team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches

the teams tested their solutions in august at the msfc a saturn stage ic was equipped with devices to demonstrate the teams solution to the problem of pogo oscillation while a saturn stage ii was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions once nasa administrators were convinced that the problems had been solved they gave their approval for a crewed mission using

the apollo spacecraft was placed on top of the rocket on september and the rocket made the slow journey to the launch pad on testing continued all through december until the day before launch including various levels of readiness testing from through final testing of modifications to address the problems of pogo oscillation ruptured fuel lines and bad igniter lines took place on december three days before the scheduled launch






as the first crewed spacecraft to orbit more than one celestial body profile had two different sets of orbital parameters separated by a translunar injection maneuver apollo lunar missions would begin with a nominal circular earth parking orbit was launched into an initial orbit with an apogee of and a perigee of with an inclination of to the equator and an orbital period of minutes propellant venting increased the apogee by over the minutes and seconds spent in the parking orbit

this was followed by a injection tli burn of the third stage for seconds accelerating the command and service module and lm test article from an orbital velocity of to the injection velocity of which set a record for the highest speed relative to earth that humans had ever traveled this speed was slightly less than the earths escape velocity of but put into an elongated elliptical earth orbit close enough to the moon to be captured by the moons gravity

the standard lunar orbit for apollo missions was planned as a nominal circular orbit above the moons surface initial lunar orbit insertion was an ellipse with a perilune of and an apolune of at an inclination of from the lunar equator this was then circularized at by with an orbital period of minutes the effect of lunar mass concentration astronomy mascons on the orbit was found to be greater than initially over the course of the ten lunar orbits lasting twenty hours the orbital distance was perturbated to by







apollo was launched at utc eastern time zone on december using the saturn vs multistage rocket to achieve earth orbit the first stage landed in the atlantic ocean at and the second stage landed at the third stage injected the craft into earth orbit and remained attached to perform the tli burn that would put the spacecraft on a trajectory to the moon

once the space vehicle reached earth orbit both the crew and christopher c kraft jr mission control center spent the next and minutes checking that the spacecraft was in proper working order and ready for tli the proper operation of the third stage of the rocket was crucial and in the last uncrewed test it had failed to reignite for this burn collins was the first capcom on duty and at minutes and seconds after launch he radioed you are go for tli this communication meant that mission control had given official permission for to go to the moon the engine ignited on time and performed the tli burn perfectly over the next five minutes the spacecrafts speed increased from

after the had placed the mission on course for the moon the command and service modules csm the remaining spacecraft separated from it the crew then rotated the spacecraft to take photographs of the spent stage and then practiced flying in formation with it as the crew rotated the spacecraft they had their first views of the earth as they moved away from marked the first time humans had viewed the whole earth at once borman became worried that the was staying too close to the csm and suggested to mission control that the crew perform a separation maneuver mission control first suggested pointing the spacecraft towards earth and using the small apollo control system rcs thrusters on the apollo command and service module sm sm to add to their velocity away from the earth but borman did not want to lose sight of the after discussion the crew and mission control decided to burn in the earth direction to increase speed but at instead the time needed to prepare and perform the additional burn put the crew an hour behind their onboard tasks


five hours after launch mission control sent a command to the to vent its remaining fuel changing its trajectory the with the test article attached posed no further hazard to passing the orbit of the moon and going into a solar orbit with an inclination of from the ecliptic and an orbital period of days it became a categoryderelict satellites in heliocentric orbit and will continue to heliocentric orbit for many years if not retrieved

the apollo crew were the first humans to pass through the van allen radiation belts which extend up to from earth scientists predicted that passing through the belts quickly at the spacecrafts high speed would cause a radiation dosage of no more than a chest or unit during a year the average human receives a dose of to record the actual radiation dosages each crew member wore a personal radiation dosimeter that transmitted data to earth as well as three passive film dosimeters that showed the cumulative radiation experienced by the crew by the end of the mission the crew members experienced an average radiation dose of mgy sec ch



lovells main job as command module pilot was as flight officer although mission control normally performed all the actual navigation calculations it was necessary to have a crew member adept at navigation so that the crew could return to earth in case communication with mission control was lost lovell navigated by star sightings using a sextant built into the spacecraft measuring the angle between a star and the earths or the moons horizon this task was made difficult by a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft which made it hard to distinguish the stars

by seven hours into the mission the crew was about and minutes behind flight plan because of the problems in moving away from the and lovells obscured star sightings the crew placed the spacecraft into passive thermal control ptc also called barbecue roll in which the spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft in direct sunlight parts of the spacecrafts outer surface could be heated to over while the parts in shadow would be these temperatures could cause the atmospheric protection systems to crack and propellant lines to burst because it was impossible to get a perfect roll the spacecraft swept out a conical surface as it rotated the crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger


the first correction came eleven hours into the flight the crew had been awake for more than hours before launch nasa had decided at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise borman started the first sleep shift but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises testing on the ground had shown that the apollo command and service propulsion system sps engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its combustion chamber was coated first by burning the engine for a short period this first correction burn was only seconds and added about velocity retrograde and prograde motion in the direction of travel this change was less than the planned because of a bubble of helium in the nitrogen tetroxide lines which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure the crew had to use the small rcs thrusters to make up the shortfall two later planned corrections were canceled because the trajectory was found to be perfect

about an hour after starting his sleep shift borman obtained permission from flight controller to take a secobarbital barbiturate the pill had little effect borman eventually fell asleep and then awoke feeling ill he vomited twice and had a bout of this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces which the crew cleaned up as well as they could borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems but lovell and anders wanted to inform mission control the crew decided to use the data storage equipment dse which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to mission control at high speed after recording a description of bormans illness they asked mission control to check the recording stating that they would like an evaluation of the voice comments

the apollo crew and mission control medical personnel held a conference using an unoccupied control room there were two identical control rooms in houston on the second and third floors only one of which was used during a mission the conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that bormans illness was either a gastroenteritis as borman thought or a reaction to the sleeping pill researchers now believe that he was suffering from space adaptation syndrome which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their labyrinth inner ear adapts to weightlessness space adaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft project mercury and project gemini because those astronauts could not move freely in the small cabins of those spacecraft the increased cabin space in the apollo command module afforded astronauts greater freedom of movement contributing to symptoms of space sickness for borman and later astronaut rusty schweickart during


the cruise phase was a relatively uneventful part of the flight except for the crews checking that the spacecraft was in working order and that they were on course during this time nasa scheduled a television broadcast at hours after launch the crew used a camera that broadcast in only using a video camera tube tube the camera had two lens optics a very lens and a telephoto lens

during this first broadcast the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the earth appeared from space however difficulties aiming the lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the earth impossible additionally without proper optical filter the earth image became saturated by any bright source in the end all the crew could show the people watching back on earth was a bright blob after broadcasting for minutes the rotation of the spacecraft took the antenna out of view of the receiving stations on earth and they ended the transmission with lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday

by this time the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts lovell went to sleep and a half hours into the and a half hours before he had planned to a short while later anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill the crew was unable to see the moon for much of the outward cruise two factors made the moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft three of the five windows fogging up due to oils from the silicone sealant and the orientation geometry required for passive thermal control it was not until the crew had gone behind the moon that they would be able to see it for the first time

apollo made a second television broadcast at hours into the flight this time the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the earth through the telephoto lens although difficult to aim as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft the crew was able to broadcast back to earth the first television pictures of the earth the crew spent the transmission describing the earth what was visible and the colors they could see the transmission lasted minutes





at about hours and minutes into the flight and hours before entering lunar orbit the crew of became the first humans to enter the gravitational of another celestial body in other words the effect of the moons newtons law of universal gravitation on became stronger than that of the earth at the time it happened was from the moon and had a speed of relative to the moon this historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their trajectory with respect to the launch pad at kennedy space center they would continue to do so until they performed their last correction switching to a frame of reference based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit

the last major event before lunar orbit insertion loi was a second correction it was in retrograde and direct motion against the direction of travel and slowed the spacecraft down by effectively reducing the closest distance at which the spacecraft would pass the moon at exactly hours after launch about from the moon the crew burned the rcs for seconds they would now pass from the geology of the landscape

at hours into the flight the crew began to prepare for lunar orbit this maneuver had to be performed perfectly and due to orbital mechanics had to be on the far side of the moon out of contact with the earth after mission control was polled for a launch status check decision the crew was told at hours that they were go and riding the best bird we can web the black the moon david flight journal lovell replied well see you on the other side and for the first time in history humans travelled behind the moon and out of radio contact with the earth

with ten minutes remaining before the crew began one last check of the spacecraft systems and made sure that every switch was in its correct position at that time they finally got their first glimpses of the moon they had been flying over the unlit side and it was lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight wiktionaryobliquely illuminating the lunar surface the loi burn was only two minutes away so the crew had little time to appreciate the view



the sps was ignited at hours and seconds after launch and burned for and placing the spacecraft in orbit around the moon the crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives if the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly ellipse lunar orbit or even been flung off into space if it had lasted too long they could have struck the moon after making sure the spacecraft was working they finally had a chance to look at the moon which they would orbit for the next hours

on earth mission control continued to wait if the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time the crew would have appeared early from behind the moon exactly at the calculated moment however the signal was received from the spacecraft indicating it was in a orbit around the moon

after reporting on the status of the spacecraft lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like



lovell continued to describe the terrain they were passing over one of the crews major tasks was reconnaissance of planned future landing sites on the moon especially one in mare tranquillitatis that was planned as the landing site the launch time of had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site a film camera had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record one frame per second of the moon below bill anders spent much of the next hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest by the end of the mission the crew had taken over eight hundred still photographs and of movie film

throughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with earth borman kept asking how the data for the sps looked he wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the earth if necessary he also asked that they receive a go decision before they passed behind the moon on each orbit

as they reappeared for their second pass in front of the moon the crew set up equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface anders described the craters that they were passing over at the end of this second orbit they performed an burn of the sps to circularize the orbit to

throughout the next two orbits the crew continued to check the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the moon during the third pass borman read a small prayer for his church he had been scheduled to participate in a service at st christophers episcopal church united states near seabrook texas but due to the flight he was unable to attend a fellow parishioner and engineer at mission control rod rose suggested that borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service





when the spacecraft came out from behind the moon for its fourth pass across the front the crew witnessed an earthrise in person for the first time in human history nasas lunar orbiter had taken the first picture of an earthrise from the vicinity of the moon on august anders saw the earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon and called in excitement to the others taking a photograph as he did so anders asked lovell for color film and then took earthrise a now famous color photo later picked by life magazine magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century

due to the tidal locking of the moon about the earth earthrise is not generally visible from the lunar surface this is because as seen from any one place on the moons surface earth remains in approximately the same position in the lunar sky either above or below the horizon earthrise is generally visible only while orbiting the moon and at selected surface locations near the moons lunar limb where libration carries the earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon


anders continued to take photographs while lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so that borman could rest despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft borman was able to sleep for two orbits awakening periodically to ask questions about their status borman awoke fully however when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes they were beginning to not understand questions and had to ask for the answers to be repeated borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good nights sleep in over three days he ordered anders and lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the moon be scrubbed anders initially protested saying that he was fine but borman would not be swayed anders finally agreed under the condition that borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic pictures of the moon borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert for the next two orbits anders and lovell slept while borman sat at the helm

as they rounded the moon for the ninth time the astronauts began the second television transmission borman introduced the crew followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the moon borman described it as being a vast lonely forbidding expanse of nothing then after talking about what they were flying over anders said that the crew had a message for all those on earth each man on board apollo genesis reading from the book of genesis borman finished the broadcast by wishing a merry christmas to everyone on earth his message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit borman said and from the crew of we close with good night good luck a merry christmas and god bless all of of you on the good earth

the only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the injection tei which was scheduled for hours after the end of the television transmission the tei was the most critical burn of the flight as any failure of the sps to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit with little hope of escape as with the previous burn the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the moon out of contact with earth the burn occurred exactly on time the spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it from behind the moon at hours minutes and seconds the exact time calculated when voice contact was regained lovell announced please be informed there is a santa claus to which ken mattingly the current capcom replied thats affirmative you are the best ones to know the spacecraft began its journey back to earth on december christmas day



later lovell used some otherwise idle time to do some navigational sightings maneuvering the module to view various stars by using the apollo guidance computer keyboard however he accidentally erased some of the computers memory which caused the apollo measurement unit imu to contain data indicating that the module was in the same relative orientation it had been in before the imu then fired the thrusters to correct the modules attitude

once the crew realized why the computer had changed the modules attitude they realized that they would have to reenter data to tell the computer the modules actual orientation it took lovell ten minutes to figure out the right numbers using the thrusters to get the stars rigel and sirius aligned and another minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer sixteen months later during the apollo mission lovell would have to perform a similar manual realignment under more critical conditions after the modules imu had to be turned off to conserve energy





the cruise back to earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft as long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly the spacecraft would reenter earths atmosphere days after tei and splashdown spacecraft landing in the pacific

on christmas afternoon the crew made their fifth television broadcast








this time they gave a tour of the spacecraft showing how an astronaut lived in space when they finished broadcasting they found a small present from slayton in the food locker a real turkey dinner with stuffing in the same kind of pack given to the troops in vietnam

another slayton surprise was a gift of three miniature alcohol of brandy which borman ordered the crew to leave alone until after they landed they remained unopened even years after the flight there were also small presents to the crew from their wives the next day at about hours into the mission the sixth and final tv transmission showed the missions best video images of the earth during a broadcast








after two uneventful days the crew prepared for reentry the computer would control the reentry and all the crew had to do was put the spacecraft in the correct attitude with the blunt end forward in the event of computer failure borman was ready to take over

separation from the service module prepared the command module for reentry by exposing the heat shield and shedding unneeded mass the service module would burn up in the atmosphere as planned six minutes before they hit the top of the atmosphere the crew saw the moon rising above the earths horizon just as had been calculated by the trajectory specialists as the module hit the thin outer atmosphere the crew noticed that it was becoming hazy outside as glowing plasma physics formed around the spacecraft the spacecraft started slowing down and the deceleration peaked at with the computer controlling the descent by changing the flight dynamics aircraft of the spacecraft rose briefly like a skipping stone before descending to the ocean at the drogue parachute deployed stabilizing the spacecraft followed at by the three main parachutes the spacecraft splashdown position was officially reported as in the north pacific ocean southwest of hawaii at utc on december



when the spacecraft hit the water the parachutes dragged it over and left it upside down in what was termed position as they were buffeted by a swell borman was sick waiting for the three flotation balloons to right the spacecraft about six minutes after splashdown the command module was righted into a normal orientation by its inflatable bag uprighting system the first frogman from aircraft carrier arrived minutes after splashdown minutes later the crew was safe on the flight deck of the yorktown




apollo came at the end of a year that had seen much upheaval in the united states and most of the world even though the year saw political assassinations political unrest in the streets of europe and america and the prague spring time magazine magazine chose the crew of as its time person of the year for recognizing them as the people who most influenced events in the preceding year they had been the first people ever to leave the gravitational influence of the earth and orbit another celestial body they had survived a mission that even the crew themselves had rated as having only a chance of fully succeeding the effect of was summed up in a telegram from a stranger received by borman after the mission that stated simply thank you you saved

one of the most famous aspects of the flight was the earthrise picture that the crew took as they came around for their fourth orbit of the moon this was the first time that humans had taken such a picture while actually behind the camera and it has been credited as one of the inspirations of the first earth day in it was selected as the first of life magazines photographs that changed the world


apollo astronaut michael collins said eights momentous historic significance was while space historian robert k poole saw as the most historically significant of all the apollo missions the mission was the most widely covered by the media since the first american orbital flight by john glenn in there were journalists covering the mission with the bbcs coverage broadcast in countries in different languages the soviet newspaper pravda featured a quote from boris nikolaevich petrov chairman of the soviet interkosmos program who described the flight as an outstanding achievement of american space sciences and technology it is estimated that a quarter of the people alive at the time live or christmas eve transmission during the ninth orbit of the moon the broadcasts won an emmy award the highest honor given by the academy of television arts sciences

madalyn murray ohair an atheism later caused controversy by bringing a lawsuit against nasa over the reading from genesis ohair wanted the courts to ban american were all government public prayer in space though the case was rejected by the supreme court of the united states apparently for lack of jurisdiction in outer space it caused nasa to be skittish about the issue of religion throughout the rest of the apollo program buzz aldrin on presbyterianism eucharist on the surface of the moon after he refrained from mentioning this publicly for several years and referred to it only obliquely at the time


in the united states post office department issued a postage stamp scott catalogue commemorating the flight around the moon the stamp featured a detail of the famous photograph of the earthrise over the moon taken by anders on christmas eve and the words in the beginning god the first words of the book of genesis in january just days after the crews return to earth they appeared in the super bowl iii show reciting the pledge of allegiance united states before the the banner was performed by trumpeter lloyd geisler of the national symphony orchestranfls website erroneously states that anita bryant performed the anthem but nbcs broadcast of game available from the paley center for medias collection shows that geisler performed it



in january the spacecraft was delivered to osaka japan for display in the us pavilion at expo it is now displayed at the chicago museum of science and industry chicago along with a collection of personal items from the flight donated by lovell and the space suit worn by frank borman jim lovells space suit is on public display in the visitor center at nasas glenn research center bill anderss space suit is on display at the science museum london in london united kingdom



apollo historic mission has been depicted and referred to in several forms both documentary and fiction the various television transmissions and mm film footage shot by the crew of were compiled and released by nasa in the documentary debrief hosted by burgess meredith debrief apollo was released as a bonus feature for the discovery channels miniseries dvd release in addition spacecraft films released in a dvd set containing all of nasas tv and film footage related to the mission including all tv transmissions from space training and launch footage and motion pictures taken in flight other documentaries include race to the moon as part of american experience season and in the shadow of the moon film apollos daring mission aired on pbs in december marking the flights anniversary

parts of the mission are dramatized in the miniseries from the earth to the moon miniseries episode from the earth to the moon the stage of was also portrayed as the location of an alien device in the ufo tv series episode conflict lunar orbit insertion was chronicled with actual recordings in the song the other side on the album the race for space album by the band public service broadcasting band

a documentary film first to the moon the journey of apollo was released in

the choral music piece earthrise by luke byrne commemorates the mission the piece was on january by sydney philharmonia choirs at the sydney opera house








































































































an astronaut from the greek astron meaning star and nautes meaning is a person trained equipped and deployed by a list of human spaceflight programs to serve as a commander or crew member aboard a spacecraft although generally reserved for professional space travelers the terms are sometimes applied to anyone who travels into space including scientists politicians journalists and space tourism

astronaut technically applies to all human space travelers regardless of nationality or however astronauts fielded by russia or the soviet union are typically known instead as cosmonauts from the russian kosmos meaning universe also borrowed from in order to distinguish them from american or otherwise space travellers comparatively recent developments in manned spaceflight made by china and other east asian nations have also led to the rise of the term taikonaut from the standard chinese meaning although its use is somewhat informal and its origin is unclear

until astronauts were sponsored and trained exclusively by governments either by the military or by civilian space agencies with the suborbital flight of the privately funded spaceshipone in a new category of astronaut was created the commercial astronaut




the criteria for what constitutes human spaceflight vary with some focus on the point where the atmosphere becomes so thin that centrifugal force rather than aerodynamic force carries a significant portion of the weight of the flight object the internationale fai sporting code for astronautics recognizes only flights that exceed the line at an altitude of in the united states professional military and commercial astronauts who travel above an altitude of are awarded astronaut badge


of these list of apollo astronauts have traveled beyond low earth orbit either to lunar orbit the lunar surface or in one case a loop around the moonapollo had to abort an intended lunar landing and looped around the moon to return its three astronauts to earth three of the lovell john watts young and eugene so twice



















in when both the united states and soviet union were planning but had yet to launch humans into space nasa administrator t keith glennan and his deputy administrator hugh latimer dryden discussed whether spacecraft crew members should be called astronauts or cosmonauts dryden preferred cosmonaut on the grounds that flights would occur in and to the broader cosmos while the astro prefix suggested flight specifically to the stars most nasa space task group members preferred astronaut which survived by common usage as the preferred american term when the soviet union launched the first man into space yuri gagarin in they chose a term which anglicization to cosmonaut



a professional space traveler is called an astronaut the first known use of the term astronaut in the modern sense was by neil r jones in his short story the deaths head meteor the word itself had been known for example in percy gregs book across the zodiac astronaut referred to a spacecraft in les navigateurs de linfini by rosny the word astronautique astronautic was used the word may have been inspired by aeronaut an older term for an air traveler first applied in to balloon aircraftists an early use of astronaut in a publication is eric frank russells poem the astronaut appearing in the november bulletin of the british interplanetary societyingham john l into your tent plantech page

the first known formal use of the term astronautics in the scientific community was the establishment of the annual international astronautical congress in and the subsequent founding of the international astronautical federation the following year

nasa applies the term astronaut to any crew member aboard nasa spacecraft bound for earth orbit or beyond nasa also uses the term as a title for those selected to join its nasa astronaut corps the european space agency similarly uses the term astronaut for members of its european astronaut corps





by convention an astronaut employed by the russian federal space agency or its soviet space program predecessor is called a cosmonaut in english texts the word is an anglicization of kosmonavt other countries of the former eastern bloc use variations of the russian kosmonavt such as the although polish also uses and the two words are considered synonyms

coinage of the term has been credited to soviet aeronautics or cosmonautics pioneer mikhail tikhonravov the first cosmonaut was soviet air force pilot yuri gagarin also the first person in space he was part of the first six russians with german titov yevgeny khrunov andriyan nikolayev pavel popovich and grigoriy nelyubov who were given the title of in january valentina tereshkova was the first female cosmonaut and the first and youngest women in space with a solo mission on the vostok in on march norman thagard became the first american to ride to space on board a russian launch vehicle and thus became the first american cosmonaut




in chinese language the term navigating personnel is used for astronauts and cosmonauts in general while navigating outer space personnel is used for chinese astronauts here is strictly defined as the navigation of outer space within the local star system ie solar system the phrase spaceman is often used in hong kong and taiwan

the term taikonaut is used by some news media organizations for professional chinese space program the word has featured in the longman and oxford english dictionary dictionaries and the term became more common in when china sent its first astronaut yang liwei into space aboard the shenzhou spacecraft this is the term used by xinhua news agency in the english version of the chinese peoples daily since the advent of the chinese space program the origin of the term is as early as may chiew lee yih from malaysia used it in newsgroups



for its european space agency astronaut group esa envisions to recruit an astronaut with a physical disability a category they called parastronauts with the intention but not guarantee of spaceflight sought as esa recruits its first new astronauts in more than a decade the categories of disability considered for the program were individuals with lower limb deficiency either through amputation or congenital leg length difference or a short stature cm parastronaut project


with the rise of space tourism nasa and the russian federal space agency agreed to use the term spaceflight participant to distinguish those space travelers from professional astronauts on missions coordinated by those two agencies


while no nation other than russia and previously the soviet union the united states and china have launched a crewed spacecraft several other nations have sent people into space in cooperation with one of these countries ie the interkosmos program inspired partly by these missions other synonyms for astronaut have entered occasional english usage for example the term spationaut is sometimes used to describe french space travelers from the latin word for the malay language term deriving from akasha meaning space was used to describe participants in the angkasawan program note its similarity with the indonesian language term and the indian space research organisation hope to launch a gaganyaan in that would carry vyomanauts coined from the sanskrit word meaning sky or space in finland the nasa astronaut timothy kopra a finnish americans has sometimes been referred to as from the finnish language word across germanic languages astronaut is used in conjunction with words like germans raumfahrer dutchs ruimtevaarder swedishs rymdfarare and norwegians romfarer

as of in the united states astronaut status is conferred on a person depending on the authorizing agency














the first human in space was soviet yuri gagarin who was launched on april aboard vostok and orbited around the earth for minutes the first woman in space was soviet valentina tereshkova who launched on june aboard vostok and orbited earth for almost three days

alan shepard became the first american and second person in space on may on a flight aboard the first american to orbit the earth was john glenn aboard friendship on february the first american woman in space was sally ride during space shuttle challengers mission on june in mae jemison became the first african american woman to travel in space aboard

cosmonaut alexei leonov was the first person to conduct an extravehicular activity eva commonly called a spacewalk on march on the soviet unions voskhod mission this was followed two and a half months later by astronaut ed white astronaut who made the first american eva on nasas gemini mission

the first crewed mission to orbit the moon apollo included american william anders who was born in hong kong making him the first astronaut in

the soviet union through its intercosmos program allowed people from other socialism ie warsaw pact and other countries to fly on its missions with the notable exceptions of france and austria participating in soyuz and soyuz respectively an example is czechoslovak remek the first cosmonaut from a country other than the soviet space program or the nasa who flew to space in on a rocket rakesh sharma became the first indian citizen to travel to space he was launched aboard soyuz on april

on july pham tuan of vietnam became the first asian people in space when he flew aboard soyuz also in cubans arnaldo tamayo became the first person of hispanic and black african descent to fly in space and in guion bluford became the first african american to fly into space in april taylor wang became the first ethnic chinese person in space the first person born in africa to fly in space was patrick baudry france in in saudi arabian sultan salman became the first arab muslim astronaut in space in abdul ahad mohmand became the first afghanistan to reach space spending nine days aboard the mir space station

with the increase of seats on the space shuttle the us began taking international astronauts in ulf merbold of west germany became the first citizen to fly in a us spacecraft in marc garneau became the first of eight canadian astronauts to fly in space through
in rodolfo neri vela became the first person in space in helen sharman became the first briton to fly in space
in mark shuttleworth became the first citizen of an african country to fly in space as a paying spaceflight participant in ilan ramon became the first israeli to fly in space although he died during a space shuttle columbia disaster

on october yang liwei became chinas first astronaut on the shenzhou spacecraft

on may doug hurley and bob behnken became the first astronauts to launch on a private crewed spacecraft spacex dragon



the youngest person to fly in space is gherman titov who was years old when he flew vostok titov was also the first person to suffer space sickness
the oldest person who has flown in space was john glenn who was when he flew on


days is the longest time spent in space by russian valeri polyakov
as of the most spaceflights by an individual astronaut is seven a record held by both jerry l ross and franklin the farthest distance from earth an astronaut has traveled was when jim lovell jack swigert and fred haise went around the moon during the apollo emergency


the first civilian in space was valentina tereshkova aboard vostok she also became the first woman in space on that mission
tereshkova was only honorarily inducted into the ussrs air force which did not accept female pilots at that time a month later joseph albert walker became the first american civilian in space when his flight crossed the line qualifying him by the international definition of spaceflight walker had joined the us army air force but was not a member during his flight
the first people in space who had never been a member of any countrys armed forces were both konstantin feoktistov and boris yegorov aboard voskhod

the first space traveler was byron k lichtenberg a researcher from the massachusetts institute of technology who flew on in in december toyohiro akiyama became the first paying space traveler and the first journalist in space for tokyo broadcasting system a visit to mir as part of an estimated usd deal with a japanese tv station although at the time the term used to refer to akiyama was research cosmonaut akiyama suffered severe space adaptation syndrome during his mission which affected his productivity

the first space tourist was dennis tito on board the russian spacecraft soyuz on april



the first person to fly on an entirely privately funded mission was mike melvill piloting spaceshipone flight on a suborbital journey although he was a test pilot employed by scaled composites and not an actual paying space tourist seven others have paid the russian space agency to fly into space













the first nasa astronauts were selected for training in early in the space program military jet test piloting and engineering training were often cited as prerequisites for selection as an astronaut at nasa although neither john glenn nor scott carpenter of the mercury seven had any university degree in engineering or any other discipline at the time of their selection selection was initially limited to military pilots the earliest astronauts for both the us and the ussr tended to be fighter aircraft pilots and were often test pilots

once selected nasa astronauts go through twenty months of training in a variety of areas including training for extravehicular activity in a facility such as nasas neutral buoyancy laboratory astronaut candidates may also experience short periods of weightlessness environment in an aircraft called the vomit comet the nickname given to a pair of modified retired in and respectively and replaced in with a mcdonnell douglas which perform parabola flights astronauts are also required to accumulate a number of flight hours in jet aircraft this is mostly done in talon out of ellington field due to its proximity to the johnson space center ellington field is also where the shuttle training aircraft is maintained and developed although most flights of the aircraft are conducted from edwards air force base

astronauts in training must learn how to control and fly the space shuttle and it is vital that they are familiar with the international space station so they know what they must do when they get there

















educator astronaut project or educator astronauts were first selected in and as of there are three nasa educator astronauts joseph m acaba richard r arnold and dorothy
barbara morgan selected as teacher to christa mcauliffe in is considered to be the first educator astronaut by the media but she trained as a mission specialist
the educator astronaut program is a successor to the teacher in space program from the




astronauts are susceptible to a variety of health risks including decompression sickness barotrauma immunodeficiencies loss of bone and muscle loss of eyesight orthostatic intolerance sleep disturbances and radiation injury a variety of large scale medical studies are being conducted in space via the national space biomedical research institute nsbri to address these issues prominent among these is the advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity study in which astronauts including former iss commanders leroy chiao and gennady padalka perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts to diagnose and potentially treat hundreds of medical conditions in space this studys techniques are now being applied to cover professional and olympic games sports injuries as well as ultrasound performed by operators in medical and high school students it is anticipated that remote guided ultrasound will have application on earth in emergency and rural health situations where access to a trained physician is often rare nasa advanced diagnostic ultrasound in microgravity evaluation of shoulder integrity in space first report of musculoskeletal us on the international space station

a space shuttle experiment found that salmonella typhimurium a bacterium that can cause food poisoning became more virulent when cultivated in space more recently in bacteria were found to be more resistant to antibiotics and to thrive in the of space microorganisms have been observed to survive the vacuum of outer space

on december a study reported that human spaceflight may harm the brain and accelerate the onset of alzheimers disease

in october the nasa office of inspector general issued a effect of spaceflight on the human body related to human space exploration including a human mission to mars

over the last decade flight surgeons and scientists at nasa have seen a pattern of vision problems in astronauts on space missions the syndrome known as visual impairment due to intracranial pressure has been reported in nearly of space explorers after long periods spent aboard the international space station iss

on november scientists reported that significant changes in the position and structure of the brain have been found in astronauts who have taken human spaceflight based on magnetic resonance imaging astronauts who took longer space trips were associated with greater brain changes

being in space can be physiologically deconditioning on the body it can affect the otolith organs and adaptive capabilities of the central nervous system zero gravity and cosmic rays can cause many implications for astronauts

in october researchers found that lengthy journeys into outer space including travel to the mars may substantially damage the gastrointestinal tract of astronauts the studies support earlier work that found such journeys could significantly damage the brains of astronauts and ageing them prematurely

researchers in reported after detecting the presence on the international space station iss of five enterobacter bacterial strains none pathogenic to humans that microorganisms on iss should be carefully monitored to continue assuring a medically healthy environment for astronauts

a study by russian scientists published in april stated that astronauts facing space radiation could face temporary hindrance of their memory centers while this does not affect their intellectual capabilities it temporarily hinders formation of new cells in brains memory centers the study conducted by moscow institute of physics and technology mipt concluded this after they observed that mice exposed to neutron and gamma radiation did not impact the rodents intellectual can impact astronauts memory temporarily heres all you need to know health tips and april

a clinical trial conducted on the brains of eight male russian cosmonauts after they returned from long stays aboard the international space station showed that human spaceflight causes many physiological adaptions including and microstructure changes while scientists still know little about the effects of spaceflight on brain structure this study showed that space travel can lead to new fine motor skill but also slightly weaker visual perception both of which could possibly be long lasting it was the first study to provide clear evidence of neuroplasticity which is the brains ability to change through growth and reorganization




an astronaut on the international space station requires about mass of food per meal each day inclusive of about packaging mass per meal

space shuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appealed to their individual tastes five months before flight menus were selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure bee formula on earth the average american uses about of water every day on board the iss astronauts limit water use to only about per day



in russia cosmonauts are awarded of the russian federation upon completion of their missions often accompanied with the award of hero of the russian federation this follows the practice established in the ussr where cosmonauts were usually awarded the title hero of the soviet union

at nasa those who complete astronaut candidate training receive a silver astronaut astronaut pins once they have flown in space they receive a gold pin us astronauts who also have military status receive a special qualification badge known as the astronaut badge after participation on a spaceflight the united states air force also presents an astronaut badge to its pilots who exceed in altitude








astronaut david scott left a memorial consisting of a statuette titled fallen astronaut on the surface of the moon during his apollo mission along with a list of the names of eight of the astronauts and six cosmonauts known at the time to have died in service

the space mirror memorial which stands on the grounds of the kennedy space center visitor complex is maintained by the astronauts memorial foundation and commemorates the lives of the men and women who have died during spaceflight and during training in the space programs of the united states in addition to twenty nasa career astronauts the memorial includes the names of an test pilot a us air force officer who died while training for a military space program and a civilian spaceflight participant
















































































a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being a burthen to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the publick commonly referred to as a modest proposal is a juvenalian satire essay written and published anonymously by jonathan swift in the essay suggests that the impoverished irish might ease their economic troubles by human cannibalism to rich gentlemen and ladies this satirical hyperbole mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor as well as kingdom of great britain policy toward the irish in general

in english writing the phrase a wiktmodest proposal is now conventionally an allusion to this style of satire


swifts essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the english language much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in ireland so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of swifts solution when he states a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout

swift goes to great lengths to support his argument including a list of possible preparation styles for the children and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion he uses methods of argument throughout his essay which parody the william petty and the social engineering political science popular among followers of francis bacon these lampoons include appeal to authority of a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london and the famous george psalmanazar a native of the island taiwan who had already confessed to not being from formosa in

in the tradition of roman satire swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by paralipsis


therefore i repeat let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients till he hath at least some glympse of hope that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into


george wittkowsky argued that swifts main target in a modest proposal was not the conditions in ireland but rather the spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic illswittkowsky modest proposal p swift was especially attacking projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple solutionwittkowsky modest proposal p a memorable example of these sorts of schemes involved the idea of running the poor through a company in response swifts modest proposal was a burlesque of projects concerning the poorwittkowsky swifts modest proposal p that were in vogue during the early century

a modest proposal also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects the pamphlet targets reformers who regard people as commoditieswittkowsky swifts modest proposal p in the piece swift adopts the technique of a political arithmeticianwittkowsky swifts modest proposal p to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics

critics differ about swifts intentions in using this philosophy edmund wilson argues that statistically the logic of the modest proposal can be compared with defence of crime arrogated to karl marx in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population wittkowsky counters that swifts satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that springs from a spirit of bitter mockery not from the delight in calculations for their own sakewittkowsky swifts modest proposal p


charles k smith argues that swifts rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the irish swifts specific strategy is twofold using a trapsmith toward a participatory rhetoric p to create sympathy for the irish and a dislike of the narrator who in the span of one sentence details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty but feels emotion solely for members of his own classsmith toward a participatory rhetoric p swifts use of gripping details of poverty and his narrators cool approach towards them create two opposing points of view that alienate the reader perhaps unconsciously from a narrator who can view with melancholy detachment a subject that swift has directed us rhetorically to see in a much less detached way

swift has his proposer further degrade the irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals lewis argues that the speaker uses the vocabulary of animal husbandrysmith toward a participatory rhetoric p to describe the irish once the children have been commodified swifts rhetoric can easily turn people into animals then meat and from meat logically into tonnage worth a price per pound

swift uses the proposers serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal in making his argument the speaker uses the conventional order of argument from swifts time which was derived from the latin rhetorician quintiliansmith toward a participatory rhetoric p the contrast between the careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme and the ridiculousness of the proposal create a situation in which the reader has to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent thoughtful and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan


scholars have speculated about which earlier works swift may have had in mind when he wrote a modest proposal


james william johnson argues that a modest proposal was largely influenced and inspired by tertullians apologeticus a satirical attack against early roman persecution of christianity johnson believes that swift saw major similarities between the two situationsjohnson tertullian and a modest proposal p johnson notes swifts obvious affinity for tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works a modest proposal and apologyjohnson tertullian and a modest proposal p in structure johnson points out the same central theme that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument that human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human stylistically swift and tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language in agreement with johnson donald c baker points out the similarity between both authors tones and use of irony baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic justification by ownership over the subject of sacrificing while attacking pagan parents and swift while attacking the english mistreatment of the irish poorbaker tertullian and swifts a modest proposal p


it has also been argued that a modest proposal was at least in part a response to the essay the generous projector or a friendly proposal to prevent murder and other enormous abuses by erecting an hospital for foundlings and bastard children by swifts rival daniel defoe


bernard mandevilles modest defence of publick stews asked to introduce public and state controlled bordellos the paper acknowledges womens interests andwhile not being a completely satirical texthas also been discussed as an inspiration for jonathan swifts titleeine essay von ursula pia jauch carl hanser verlag mandeville had by already become famous for the the fable of the bees and deliberations on private vices and public benefits


john locke commented be it then as sir robert says that anciently it was usual for men to sell and castrate their children let it be that they exposed add to it if you please for this is still greater power that they begat them for their tables to fat and eat them if this proves a right to do so we may by the same argument justifie adultery incest and sodomy for there are examples of these too both ancient and sins which i suppose have the principle aggravation from this that they cross the main intention of nature which willeth the increase of mankind and the continuation of the species in the highest perfection and the distinction of families with the security of the marriage bed as necessary thereunto first treatise sec


robert phiddians article have you eaten the reader in a modest proposal focuses on two aspects of a modest proposal the voice of swift and the voice of the proposer phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satirical voice of jonathan swift and the apparent economic projections of the proposer he reminds readers that there is a gap between the narrators meaning and the texts and that a argument is being carried out by means of parodyphiddian have you eaten p

while swifts proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal george wittkowsky author of swifts modest proposal the biography of an early georgian pamphlet argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of swifts time wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in century england if one regards the modest proposal simply as a criticism of condition about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that swifts irony brilliantly underscored this factphiddian have you eaten p


at the start of a new industrial age in the century it was believed that people are the riches of the nation and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work lessphiddian have you eaten p furthermore in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry in those times the somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity

louis a landa composed a conducive analysis when he noted that it would have been healthier for the irish economy to more appropriately utilize their human assets by giving the people an opportunity to become a source of wealth to the nation or else they must turn to begging and thievery this opportunity may have included giving the farmers more coin to work for diversifying their professions or even consider enslaving their people to lower coin usage and build up financial stock in ireland landa wrote that swift is maintaining that the are the riches of a to ireland only if ireland is permitted slavery or cannibalism

landa presents swifts a modest proposal as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the century that people are the riches of a nationlanda a modest proposal and populousness p swift presents the dire state of ireland and shows that mere population itself in irelands case did not always mean greater wealth and economylanda a modest proposal and populousness p the uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer not richer swift also recognises the implications of this fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens swift however landa argues is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that england was denying irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity


swifts essay created a backlash within the community after its publication the work was aimed at the aristocracy and they responded in turn several members of society wrote to swift regarding the work allen bathurst earl bathursts letter intimated that he certainly understood the message and interpreted it as a work of comedy

february did immediately propose it to lady bathurst as your advice particularly for her last boy which was born the plumpest finest thing that could be but she fell in a passion and bid me send you word that she would not follow your direction but that she would breed him up to be a parson and he should live upon the fat of the or a lawyer and then instead of being eat himself he should devour others you know women in passion never mind what they but as she is a very reasonable woman i have almost brought her over now to your and having convinced her that as matters stood we could not possibly maintain all the nine she does begin to think it reasonable the youngest should raise fortunes for the eldest and upon that foot a man may perform family duty with more courage and for if he should happen to get twins the selling of one might provide for the other or if by any accident while his wife lies in with one child he should get a second upon the body of another woman he might dispose of the fattest of the two and that would help to breed up the otherthe more i think upon this scheme the more reasonable it appears to and it ought by no means to be confined to for in all probability we shall in a very little time be altogether as poor here as you are there i believe indeed we shall carry it farther and not confine our luxury only to the eating of for i happened to peep the other day into a large assembly parliament not far from and i found them roasting a great fat fellow walpole again for my own part i had not the least inclination to a slice of but if i guessed right four or five of the company had a devilish mind to be at him well adieu you begin now to wish i had ended when i might have done it so conveniently


a modest proposal is included in many literature courses as an example of modern western satire it also serves as an introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language lending itself to secondary and essay courses outside of the realm of english studies a modest proposal is included in many comparative and global literature and history courses as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts humanities and even the social sciences

the essays approach has been copied many times in his book a modest proposal the evangelical author francis schaeffer emulated swifts work in a social conservative polemic against abortion and euthanasia imagining a future dystopia that advocates recycling of aborted embryos fetuses and some disabled infants with compound intellectual physical and physiological difficulties such baby doe rules cases were then a major concern of the us movement of the early which viewed selective treatment of those infants as disability discrimination in his book a modest proposal for america statistician howard friedman opens with a satirical reflection of the extreme drive to fiscal stability by

the alkali metals consist of the chemical elements lithium li sodium na potassium kthe symbols na and k for sodium and potassium are derived from their latin names natrium and these are still the origins of the names for the elements in some languages such as german and russian rubidium rb caesium is the spelling recommended by the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac the american chemical society acs has used the spelling cesium since following websters third new international and francium fr together with hydrogen they constitute group periodic both the old iupac and the chemical abstracts service systems for group numbering this group is known as group ia pronounced as group one a as the i is a roman which lies in the of the periodic table all alkali metals have their outermost electron in an atomic orbital this shared electron configuration results in their having very similar characteristic properties indeed the alkali metals provide the best example of periodic trends in properties in the periodic table with elements exhibiting homology chemistry behaviour this family of elements is also known as the lithium family after its leading element

the alkali metals are all shiny hardness highly reactivity chemistry metals at standard temperature and pressure and readily lose their valence electron to form cations with electric charge they can all be cut easily with a knife due to their softness exposing a shiny surface that tarnishes rapidly in air due to redox by atmospheric moisture and oxygen and in the case of lithium nitrogen because of their high reactivity they must be stored under oil to prevent reaction with air and are found naturally only in salt chemistry and never as the free elements caesium the fifth alkali metal is the most reactive of all the metals all the alkali metals react with water with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones

all of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds in order of abundance of the chemical elements sodium is the most abundant followed by potassium lithium rubidium caesium and finally francium which is very rare due to its extremely high francium occurs only in minute trace radioisotope in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural decay chains experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of ununennium uue which is likely to be the next member of the none was successful however ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to relativistic quantum chemistry which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of superheavy even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues

most alkali metals have many different applications one of the applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in atomic clocks of which caesium atomic clocks form the basis of the second a common application of the compounds of sodium is the lamp which emits light very efficiently salt or sodium chloride has been used since antiquity lithium medication finds use as a psychiatric medication and as an anode in lithium batteries sodium and potassium are also essential elements having major biological roles as electrolytes and although the other alkali metals are not essential they also have various effects on the body both beneficial and harmful





sodium compounds have been known since ancient salt sodium chloride has been an important commodity in human activities as testified by the english word salary referring to salarium money paid to roman soldiers for the purchase of salt while potash has been used since ancient times it was not understood for most of its history to be a fundamentally different substance from sodium mineral salts georg ernst stahl obtained experimental evidence which led him to suggest the fundamental difference of sodium and potassium salts in and duhamel du monceau was able to prove this difference in the exact chemical composition of potassium and sodium compounds and the status as chemical element of potassium and sodium was not known then and thus antoine lavoisier did not include either alkali in his list of chemical elements in

pure potassium was first isolated in in england by humphry davy who derived it from potassium hydroxide koh potassium hydroxide by the use of electrolysis of the molten salt with the newly invented voltaic pile previous attempts at electrolysis of the aqueous salt were unsuccessful due to potassiums extreme reactivity potassium was the first metal that was isolated by electrolysis later that same year davy reported extraction of sodium from the similar substance caustic soda naoh lye by a similar technique demonstrating the elements and thus the salts to be different


petalite lithium aluminium was discovered in by the brazilian chemist de andrada in a mine on the island of web periodic table of the elements lithium historical information november however it was not until that johan august arfwedson then working in the laboratory of the chemist jacob berzelius discovery of the chemical elements the presence of a new element while analysing petalite ore this new element was noted by him to form compounds similar to those of sodium and potassium though its lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide were less solubility and more base chemistry than the other alkali metals berzelius gave the unknown material the name from the ancient greek word transliterated as lithos meaning stone to reflect its discovery in a solid mineral as opposed to potassium which had been discovered in plant ashes and sodium which was known partly for its high abundance in animal blood he named the metal inside the material lithium lithium sodium and potassium were part of the discovery of periodic table as they are among a series of triads of elements in the same group periodic table that were noted by johann wolfgang in as having similar properties


rubidium and caesium were the first elements to be discovered using the spectroscope invented in by robert bunsen and gustav kirchhoff the next year they discovered caesium in the mineral water from bad germany their discovery of rubidium came the following year in heidelberg germany finding it in the mineral lepidolite the names of rubidium and caesium come from the most prominent lines in their emission spectrum a bright red line for rubidium from the latin word rubidus meaning dark red or bright red and a line for caesium derived from the latin word caesius meaning

around john alexander reina newlands produced a series of papers where he listed the elements in order of increasing atomic weight and similar physical and chemical properties that recurred at intervals of he likened such periodicity to the octaves of music where notes an octave apart have similar musical functions his version put all the alkali metals then known lithium to caesium as well as copper silver and thallium which show the oxidation state characteristic of the alkali metals together into a group his table placed hydrogen with the halogens


after dmitri mendeleev proposed his periodic table placing lithium at the top of a group with sodium potassium rubidium caesium and thallium two years later mendeleev revised his table placing hydrogen in group above lithium and also moving thallium to the boron group in this version copper silver and gold were placed twice once as part of group element and once as part of a group viii encompassing todays groups group element to the version of mendeleevs periodic table copper and silver were placed in their own group aligned with hydrogen and mercury element while gold was tentatively placed under uranium and the undiscovered gallium in the boron group after the introduction of the table the group ib elements were moved to their current position in the while alkali metals were left in group ia later the groups name was changed to group in the trivial name alkali metals comes from the fact that the hydroxides of the group elements are all strong alkalis when dissolved in water

there were at least four erroneous and incomplete discoveries before marguerite perey of the curie institute paris in paris france discovered francium in by purifying a sample of which had been reported to have a decay energy of however perey noticed decay particles with an energy level below perey thought this decay activity might have been caused by a previously unidentified decay product one that was separated during purification but emerged again out of the pure various tests eliminated the possibility of the unknown element being thorium radium lead bismuth or thallium the new product exhibited chemical properties of an alkali metal such as coprecipitating with caesium salts which led perey to believe that it was element caused by the alpha decay of kaufman george b september francium atomic number the last discovered natural element the chemical educator retrieved march perey then attempted to determine the proportion of beta decay to alpha decay in her first test put the alpha branching at a figure that she later revised to


the next element below francium mendeleevs predicted in the periodic table would be ununennium uue element the synthesis of ununennium was first attempted in by bombarding a target of with ions at the superhilac accelerator at berkeley california no atoms were identified leading to a limiting yield of barn unit



it is highly unlikely that this reaction will be able to create any atoms of ununennium in the near future given the extremely difficult task of making sufficient amounts of which is favoured for production of superheavy element because of its large mass relatively long of days and availability in significant amounts of several micrograms to make a large enough target to increase the sensitivity of the experiment to the required einsteinium has not been found in nature and has only been produced in laboratories and in quantities smaller than those needed for effective synthesis of superheavy elements however given that ununennium is only the first period element on the extended periodic table it may well be discovered in the near future through other reactions and indeed an attempt to synthesise it is currently ongoing in japan currently none of the period elements has been discovered yet and it is also possible due to nucleon drip line that only the lower period elements up to around element are physically possible no attempts at synthesis have been made for any heavier alkali metals due to their extremely high atomic number they would require new more powerful methods and technology to make





the rule holds that elements with even atomic numbers are more common that those with odd atomic numbers with the exception of hydrogen this rule argues that elements with odd atomic numbers have one unpaired proton and are more likely to capture another thus increasing their atomic number in elements with even atomic numbers protons are paired with each member of the pair offsetting the spin of the other enhancing stability all the alkali metals have odd atomic numbers and they are not as common as the elements with even atomic numbers adjacent to them the noble gases and the alkaline earth metals in the solar system the heavier alkali metals are also less abundant than the lighter ones as the alkali metals from rubidium onward can only be synthesised in supernovae and not in stellar nucleosynthesis lithium is also much less abundant than sodium and potassium as it is poorly synthesised in both big bang nucleosynthesis and in stars the big bang could only produce trace quantities of lithium beryllium and boron due to the absence of a stable nucleus with or nucleons and stellar nucleosynthesis could only pass this bottleneck by the process fusing three helium nuclei to form carbon and skipping over those three elements



the earth formed from the same cloud of matter that formed the sun but the planets acquired different compositions during the formation and evolution of the solar system in turn the history of earth caused parts of this planet to have differing concentrations of the elements the mass of the earth is approximately it is composed mostly of iron oxygen silicon magnesium sulfur nickel calcium and aluminium with the remaining consisting of trace amounts of other elements due to planetary differentiation the core region is believed to be primarily composed of iron with smaller amounts of nickel sulfur and less than trace elements

the alkali metals due to their high reactivity do not occur naturally in pure form in nature they are goldschmidt classification and therefore remain close to the earths surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica forming relatively minerals that do not sink down into the earths core potassium rubidium and caesium are also incompatible elements due to their large ionic radius

sodium and potassium are very abundant in earth both being among the ten abundance of elements in earths sodium makes up approximately of the earths crust measured by weight making it the abundance of the chemical elements overall and the most abundant alkali metal potassium makes up approximately of the earths crust and is the seventh most abundant element sodium is found in many different minerals of which the most common is ordinary salt sodium chloride which occurs in vast quantities dissolved in seawater other solid deposits include halite mineral amphibole cryolite nitratine and zeolite many of these solid deposits occur as a result of ancient seas evaporating which still occurs now in places such as utahs great salt lake and the dead sea despite their abundance in earths crust sodium is far more common than potassium in the ocean both because potassiums larger size makes its salts less soluble and because potassium is bound by silicates in soil and what potassium leaches is absorbed far more readily by plant life than sodium

despite its chemical similarity lithium typically does not occur together with sodium or potassium due to its smaller size due to its relatively low reactivity it can be found in seawater in large it is estimated that seawater is approximately to parts per million ppm or micromolar its diagonal relationship with magnesium often allows it to replace magnesium in ferromagnesium minerals where its crustal concentration is about per million comparable to that of gallium and niobium commercially the most important lithium mineral is spodumene which occurs in large deposits worldwide

rubidium is approximately as abundant as zinc and more abundant than copper it occurs naturally in the minerals leucite pollucite carnallite zinnwaldite and journal trace element chemistry of micas from granitic pegmatites



the only naturally occurring isotope of francium is the decay product of the alpha decay of and can be found in trace amounts in uranium minerals in a given sample of uranium there is estimated to be only one francium atom for every uranium atoms it has been calculated that there are at most of francium in the crust geology at any time due to its extremely short of minutes




the physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an valence electron configuration which results in weak metallic bonding hence all the alkali metals are soft and have low density melting point and boiling points as well as heat of sublimation heat of vaporization and dissociation chemistry they all crystallise in the cubic crystal structure and have distinctive flame test because their outer s electron is very easily excited the configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large atomic radius and ionic radius as well as very high thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost to form the oxidation state due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group the chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme radioactive thus the presentation of its properties here is limited what little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium as expected the physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations








































































the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group periodic table are to each other indeed the similarity is so great that it is quite difficult to separate potassium rubidium and caesium due to their similar ionic lithium and sodium are more distinct for instance when moving down the table all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing electronegativity increasing reactivity chemistry and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation in general their density increase when moving down the table with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium one of the very few properties of the alkali metals that does not display a very smooth trend is their reduction potentials lithiums value is anomalous being more negative than the others this is because the ion has a very high hydration energy in the gas phase though the lithium ion disrupts the structure of water significantly causing a higher change in entropy this high hydration energy is enough to make the reduction potentials indicate it as being the most electropositive alkali metal despite the difficulty of ionising it in the gas phase

the stable alkali metals are all metals except for caesium which has a pale golden tint it is one of only three metals that are clearly coloured the other two being copper and gold additionally the heavy alkaline earth metals calcium strontium and barium as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium are pale yellow though the colour is much less prominent than it is for caesium their lustre tarnishes rapidly in air due to oxidation they all crystallise in the cubic crystal structure and have distinctive flame test because their outer s electron is very easily excited indeed these flame test colours are the most common way of identifying them since all their salts with common ions are soluble



all the alkali metals are highly reactive and are never found in elemental forms in nature because of this they are usually stored in mineral oil or kerosene paraffin oil they react aggressively with the halogens to form the alkali metal halides which are white ionic crystalline compounds that are all solubility in water except lithium fluoride lithium fluorine the alkali metals also react with water to form strongly alkaline hydroxides and thus should be handled with great care the heavier alkali metals react more vigorously than the lighter for example when dropped into water caesium produces a larger explosion than potassium if the same number of moles of each metal is used the alkali metals have the lowest first ionization energy in their respective periods of the periodic table because of their low effective nuclear charge and the ability to attain a noble gas configuration by losing just one electron not only do the alkali metals react with water but also with proton donors like alcohols and phenols gaseous ammonia and alkynes the last demonstrating the phenomenal degree of their reactivity their great power as reducing agents makes them very useful in liberating other metals from their oxides or halides

the second ionisation energy of all of the alkali metals is very high as it is in a full shell that is also closer to the thus they almost always lose a single electron forming cations the alkalides are an exception they are unstable compounds which contain alkali metals in a oxidation state which is very unusual as before the discovery of the alkalides the alkali metals were not expected to be able to form anions and were thought to be able to appear in salt chemistry only as cations the alkalide anions have filled which gives them enough stability to exist all the stable alkali metals except lithium are known to be able to form alkalides and the alkalides have much theoretical interest due to their unusual stoichiometry and low ionization potential alkalides are chemically similar to the electrides which are salts with trapped electrons acting as anions a particularly striking example of an alkalide is inverse sodium hydride both ions being coordination complex as opposed to the usual sodium hydride it is unstable in isolation due to its high energy resulting from the displacement of two electrons from hydrogen to sodium although several derivatives are predicted to be metastability or stable

in aqueous solution the alkali metal ions form metal ions in aqueous solution of the formula where n is the solvation number their coordination numbers and shapes agree well with those expected from their ionic radii in aqueous solution the water molecules directly attached to the metal ion are said to belong to the first coordination sphere also known as the first or primary solvation shell the bond between a water molecule and the metal ion is a dative covalent bond with the oxygen atom donating both electrons to the bond each coordinated water molecule may be attached by hydrogen bonds to other water molecules the latter are said to reside in the second coordination sphere however for the alkali metal cations the second coordination sphere is not as the charge on the cation is not high enough to polarizability the water molecules in the primary solvation shell enough for them to form strong hydrogen bonds with those in the second coordination sphere producing a more stable entity the solvation number for has been experimentally determined to be forming the tetrahedron while solvation numbers of to have been found for lithium aqua ions solvation numbers less than may be the result of the formation of contact ion pairs and the higher solvation numbers may be interpreted in terms of water molecules that approach through a face of the tetrahedron though molecular dynamic simulations may indicate the existence of an octahedron hexaaqua ion there are also probably six water molecules in the primary solvation sphere of the sodium ion forming the octahedral ion while it was previously thought that the heavier alkali metals also formed octahedral hexaaqua ions it has since been found that potassium and rubidium probably form the and ions which have the square antiprismatic structure and that caesium forms the ion



the chemistry of lithium shows several differences from that of the rest of the group as the small cation chemical polarity anions and gives its compounds a more covalent bond character lithium and magnesium have a diagonal relationship due to their similar atomic radii so that they show some similarities for example lithium forms a stable nitride a property common among all the alkaline earth metals magnesiums group but unique among the alkali metals in addition among their respective groups only lithium and magnesium form organometallic compounds with significant covalent character eg limethyl group and

lithium fluoride is the only alkali metal halide that is poorly soluble in water and lithium hydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent conversely lithium perchlorate and other lithium salts with large anions that cannot be polarised are much more stable than the analogous compounds of the other alkali metals probably because has a high solvation energy this effect also means that most simple lithium salts are commonly encountered in hydrated form because the anhydrous forms are extremely hygroscopic this allows salts like lithium chloride and lithium bromide to be used in dehumidifiers and


francium is also predicted to show some differences due to its high atomic weight causing its electrons to travel at considerable fractions of the speed of light and thus making relativistic quantum chemistry more prominent in contrast to the trend of decreasing electronegativity and ionisation energy of the alkali metals franciums electronegativity and ionisation energy are predicted to be higher than caesiums due to the relativistic stabilisation of the also its atomic radius is expected to be abnormally low thus contrary to expectation caesium is the most reactive of the alkali metals not francium all known physical properties of francium also deviate from the clear trends going from lithium to caesium such as the first ionisation energy electron affinity and anion polarisability though due to the paucity of known data about francium many sources give extrapolated values ignoring that relativistic effects make the trend from lithium to caesium become inapplicable at francium some of the few properties of francium that have been predicted taking relativity into account are the electron affinity and the enthalpy of dissociation of the molecule the csfr molecule is polarised as showing that the subshell of francium is much more strongly affected by relativistic effects than the subshell of caesium additionally francium superoxide is expected to have significant covalent character unlike the other alkali metal superoxides because of bonding contributions from the electrons of francium


























all the alkali metals have odd atomic hence their isotopes must be either nuclei both proton and neutron number are odd or nuclei proton number is odd but neutron number is even nuclei have even mass numbers whereas nuclei have odd mass numbers primordial nuclides are rare because most nuclei are highly unstable with respect to beta decay because the decay products are and are therefore more strongly bound due to mass term

due to the great rarity of nuclei almost all the primordial isotopes of the alkali metals are the exceptions being the light stable isotope and the radioisotope for a given odd mass number there can be only a single stable isobars since there is not a difference in binding energy between and comparable to that between and leaving other nuclides of the same mass number isobar free to beta decay toward the nuclide an effect of the instability of an odd number of either type of nucleons is that elements such as the alkali metals tend to have fewer stable isotopes than elements of the monoisotopic elements that have only a single stable isotope all but one have an odd atomic number and all but one also have an even number of neutrons beryllium is the single exception to both rules due to its low atomic number

all of the alkali metals except lithium and caesium have at least one naturally occurring radioisotope and are trace radioisotopes produced cosmogenically and have very long and thus occur naturally and all isotopes of francium are radioactive decay caesium was also thought to be radioactive in the early century although it has no naturally occurring radioisotopes francium had not been discovered yet at that time the natural radioisotope of potassium makes up about of natural potassium and thus natural potassium is weakly radioactive this natural radioactivity became a basis for a mistaken claim of the discovery for element the next alkali metal after caesium in natural rubidium is similarly slightly radioactive with being the radioisotope

with a of is one of the two principal fission products along with which are responsible for most of the radioactivity of spent nuclear fuel after several years of cooling up to several hundred years after use it constitutes most of the radioactivity still left from the chernobyl accident undergoes beta decay and eventually becomes stable it is a strong emitter of gamma radiation has a very low rate of neutron capture and cannot be feasibly disposed of in this way but must be allowed to decay has been used as a flow tracer in hydrologic studies analogous to the use of tritium radioisotope brief us national center for environmental health small amounts of and were released into the environment during nearly all nuclear weapon tests and some nuclear accidents most notably the accident and the chernobyl disaster as of is the principal source of radiation in the zone of alienation around the chernobyl nuclear power plant its chemical properties as one of the alkali metals make it one of most problematic of the fission products because it easily moves and spreads in nature due to the high water solubility of its salts and is taken up by the body which mistakes it for its essential congeners sodium and potassium


the alkali metals are more similar to each other than the elements in any other group periodic table are to each other for instance when moving down the table all known alkali metals show increasing atomic radius decreasing electronegativity increasing reactivity chemistry and decreasing melting and boiling points as well as heats of fusion and vaporisation in general their density increase when moving down the table with the exception that potassium is less dense than sodium




the atomic radii of the alkali metals increase going down the group because of the shielding effect when an atom has more than one electron shell each electron feels electric repulsion from the other electrons as well as electric attraction from the nucleus in the alkali metals the valence electron only feels a net charge of as some of the nuclear charge which is equal to the atomic number is cancelled by the inner the number of inner electrons of an alkali metal is always one less than the nuclear charge therefore the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells since this number increases down the group the atomic radius must also increase down the group

the ionic radius of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii this is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different electron shell than the inner electrons and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller additionally the effective nuclear charge has increased and thus the electrons are attracted more strongly towards the nucleus and the ionic radius decreases




the first ionisation energy of an chemical element or molecule is the energy required to move the most loosely held electron from one mole unit of gaseous atoms of the element or molecules to form one mole of gaseous ions with electric charge the factors affecting the first ionisation energy are the nuclear charge the amount of shielding effect by the inner electrons and the distance from the most loosely held electron from the nucleus which is always an outer electron in main group elements the first two factors change the effective nuclear charge the most loosely held electron feels since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus since this distance increases down the group the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases this trend is broken in francium due to the relativistic quantum chemistry stabilisation and contraction of the orbital bringing franciums valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from calculations this makes franciums outermost electron feel more attraction from the nucleus increasing its first ionisation energy slightly beyond that of caesium

the second ionisation energy of the alkali metals is much higher than the first as the loosely held electron is part of a fully filled electron shell and is thus difficult to remove



the reactivities of the alkali metals increase going down the group this is the result of a combination of two factors the first ionisation energies and atomisation energy of the alkali metals because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in chemical reactions thus increasing reactivity down the group the atomisation energy measures the strength of the metallic bond of an element which falls down the group as the atoms increase in atomic radius and thus the metallic bond must increase in length making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to but not equal to the activation energy of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance this quantity decreases going down the group and so does the activation thus chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group




electronegativity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an atom or a functional group to attract electrons or electron density towards itself if the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent bond the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is in chlorine but is only in sodium the electron pair is attracted so close to the chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom an ionic bond however if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium hence the larger alkali metal atoms further down the group will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them as mentioned previously francium is expected to be an exception

because of the higher electronegativity of lithium some of its compounds have a more covalent character for example lithium iodide lithium iodine will dissolve in organic solvents a property of most covalent compounds lithium fluoride lifluorine is the only alkali halide that is not soluble in water and lithium hydroxide lihydroxide is the only alkali metal hydroxide that is not deliquescent



the melting point of a substance is the point where it changes state of matter from solid to liquid while the boiling point of a substance in liquid state is the point where the vapor pressure of the liquid equals the environmental pressure surrounding the liquid section page and all the liquid changes state to gas as a metal is heated to its melting point the metallic bonds keeping the atoms in place weaken so that the atoms can move around and the metallic bonds eventually break completely at the metals boiling point therefore the falling melting and boiling points of the alkali metals indicate that the strength of the metallic bonds of the alkali metals decreases down the group this is because metal atoms are held together by the electromagnetic attraction from the positive ions to the delocalised electrons as the atoms increase in size going down the group because their atomic radius increases the nuclei of the ions move further away from the delocalised electrons and hence the metallic bond becomes weaker so that the metal can more easily melt and boil thus lowering the melting and boiling points the increased nuclear charge is not a relevant factor due to the shielding effect



the alkali metals all have the same crystal structure cubic and thus the only relevant factors are the number of atoms that can fit into a certain volume and the mass of one of the atoms since density is defined as mass per unit volume the first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius which increases going down the thus the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group the mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group thus the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic if figures for these two factors are known the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated the resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table with an exception at potassium due to having the lowest atomic weight and the largest atomic radius of all the elements in their periods the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table lithium sodium and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water in fact lithium is the least dense known solid at room temperature


the alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions which well illustrate group trends these compounds can be described as involving the alkali metals losing electrons to acceptor species and forming monopositive ions this description is most accurate for alkali halides and becomes less and less accurate as cationic and anionic charge increase and as the anion becomes larger and more polarisable for instance ionic bonding gives way to metallic bonding along the series nacl na







all the alkali metals react vigorously or explosively with cold water producing an aqueous solution of a strongly base chemistry alkali metal hydroxide and releasing hydrogen gas this reaction becomes more vigorous going down the group lithium reacts steadily with effervescence but sodium and potassium can ignite and rubidium and caesium sink in water and generate hydrogen gas so rapidly that shock waves form in the water that may shatter glass containers when an alkali metal is dropped into water it produces an explosion of which there are two separate stages the metal reacts with the water first breaking the hydrogen bonds in the water and producing hydrogen this takes place faster for the more reactive heavier alkali metals second the heat generated by the first part of the reaction often ignites the hydrogen gas causing it to burn explosively into the surrounding air this secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water lake or other body of water not the initial reaction of the metal with water which tends to happen mostly under water the alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides

recent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a coulomb explosion rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself all alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water water molecules ionise the bare metallic surface of the liquid metal leaving a positively charged metal surface and negatively charged water ions the attraction between the charged metal and water ions will rapidly increase the surface area causing an exponential increase of ionisation when the repulsive forces within the liquid metal surface exceeds the forces of the surface tension it vigorously explodes

the hydroxides themselves are the most basic hydroxides known reacting with acids to give salts and with alcohols to give oligomeric alkoxides they easily react with carbon dioxide to form carbonates or bicarbonates or with hydrogen sulfide to form sulfides or bisulfides and may be used to separate thiols from petroleum they react with amphoteric oxides for example the oxides of aluminium zinc tin and lead react with the alkali metal hydroxides to give aluminates zincates stannates and plumbates silicon dioxide is acidic and thus the alkali metal hydroxides can also attack silicate glass



the alkali metals form many intermetallic compounds with each other and the elements from groups alkaline earth metal to boron group in the periodic table of varying stoichiometries such as the sodium amalgams with mercury element including and keith r sodium amalgam in encyclopedia of reagents for organic synthesis wiley some of these have ionic characteristics taking the alloys with gold the most electronegative of metals as an example naau and kau are metallic but rbau and caesium auride are semiconductors nak is an alloy of sodium and potassium that is very useful because it is liquid at room temperature although precautions must be taken due to its extreme reactivity towards water and air the eutectic mixture melts at an alloy of caesium sodium and potassium has the lowest known melting point of any metal or alloy


the intermetallic compounds of the alkali metals with the heavier group elements aluminium gallium indium and thallium such as natl are poor electrical conductor or semiconductors unlike the normal alloys with the preceding elements implying that the alkali metal involved has lost an electron to the zintl phase involvedsevov sc zintl phases pp in intermetallic compounds principles and practice progress vol westbrook freisher rl john wiley sons ltd chichester england nevertheless while the elements in group and beyond tend to form discrete anionic clusters group elements tend to form polymeric ions with the alkali metal cations located between the giant ionic lattice for example natl consists of a polymeric anion with a covalent diamond cubic structure with ions located between the anionic lattice the larger alkali metals cannot fit similarly into an anionic lattice and tend to force the heavier group elements to form anionic clusterssm kauzlarich encyclopedia of inorganic chemistry john wiley sons

boron is a special case being the only nonmetal in group the alkali metal borides tend to be involving appreciable bonding involving deltahedron structures and are thermally unstable due to the alkali metals having a very high vapour pressure at elevated temperatures this makes direct synthesis problematic because the alkali metals do not react with boron below and thus this must be accomplished in sealed containers with the alkali metal in excess furthermore exceptionally in this group reactivity with boron decreases down the group lithium reacts completely at but sodium at and potassium not until and the reaction is instantaneous for lithium but takes hours for potassium rubidium and caesium borides have not even been characterised various phases are known such as and under high pressure the bonding in the lithium borides changes from following polyhedral skeletal electron pair theory to forming zintl anions like the rest of group














lithium and sodium react with carbon to form acetylides and which can also be obtained by reaction of the metal with acetylene potassium rubidium and caesium react with their atoms are intercalation chemistry between the hexagonal graphite layers forming graphite intercalation compounds of formulae dark grey almost black dark grey almost black blue steel blue and bronze m k rb or cs these compounds are over times more electrically conductive than pure graphite suggesting that the valence electron of the alkali metal is transferred to the graphite layers eg upon heating of the elimination of potassium atoms results in the conversion in sequence to and finally is a very strong reducing agent and is pyrophoric and explodes on contact with water nist ionizing radiation division technical highlights physicsnistgov while the larger alkali metals k rb and cs initially form the smaller ones initially form and indeed they require reaction of the metals with graphite at high temperatures around to form apart from this the alkali metals are such strong reducing agents that they can even reduce buckminsterfullerene to produce solid fullerides sodium potassium rubidium and caesium can form fullerides where n or and rubidium and caesium additionally can achieve n

when the alkali metals react with the heavier elements in the carbon group silicon germanium tin and lead ionic substances with structures are formed such as the silicides m k rb or cs which contains and tetrahedral ions the chemistry of alkali metal germanides involving the germanide ion and other cluster zintl ion ions such as and is largely analogous to that of the corresponding silicides alkali metal stannides are mostly ionic sometimes with the stannide ion and sometimes with more complex zintl ions such as which appears in tetrapotassium nonastannide the monatomic plumbide ion is unknown and indeed its formation is predicted to be energetically alkali metal plumbides have complex zintl ions such as these alkali metal germanides stannides and plumbides may be produced by reducing germanium tin and lead with sodium metal in liquid ammonia



lithium the lightest of the alkali metals is the only alkali metal which reacts with nitrogen at standard conditions and its nitride is the only stable alkali metal nitride nitrogen is an reactivity chemistry gas because breaking the strong triple bond in the dinitrogen molecule requires a lot of energy the formation of an alkali metal nitride would consume the ionisation energy of the alkali metal forming ions the energy required to break the triple bond in and the formation of ions and all the energy released from the formation of an alkali metal nitride is from the lattice energy of the alkali metal nitride the lattice energy is maximised with small highly charged the alkali metals do not form highly charged ions only forming ions with a charge of so only lithium the smallest alkali metal can release enough lattice energy to make the reaction with nitrogen exothermic forming lithium nitride the reactions of the other alkali metals with nitrogen would not release enough lattice energy and would thus be endothermic so they do not form nitrides at standard conditions sodium nitride and potassium nitride while existing are extremely unstable being prone to decomposing back into their constituent elements and cannot be produced by reacting the elements with each other at standard conditions elusive binary compound prepared chemical engineering news no may steric hindrance forbids the existence of rubidium or caesium nitride however sodium and potassium form colourless azide salts involving the linear due to the large size of the alkali metal cations they are thermally stable enough to be able to melt before decomposing

all the alkali metals react readily with phosphorus and arsenic to form phosphides and arsenides with the formula where m represents an alkali metal and pn represents a pnictogen phosphorus arsenic antimony or bismuth this is due to the greater size of the and ions so that less lattice energy needs to be released for the salts to form these are not the only phosphides and arsenides of the alkali metals for example potassium has nine different known phosphides with formulae kp and von schnering w phosphides chemistry encyclopedia of inorganic chemistry ed r bruce king john wiley sons while most metals form arsenides only the alkali and alkaline earth metals form mostly ionic arsenides the structure of is complex with unusually short distances of pm which are shorter than in sodium metal and this indicates that even with these electropositive metals the bonding cannot be straightforwardly ionic other alkali metal arsenides not conforming to the formula are known such as lias which has a metallic lustre and electrical conductivity indicating the presence of some metallic bonding the antimonides are unstable and reactive as the ion is a strong reducing reaction of them with acids form the toxic and unstable gas stibine indeed they have some metallic properties and the alkali metal antimonides of stoichiometry msb involve antimony atoms bonded in a spiral zintl structure bismuthides are not even wholly they are intermetallic compounds containing partially metallic and partially ionic bonds















all the alkali metals react vigorously with oxygen at standard conditions they form various types of oxides such as simple oxides containing the ion peroxides containing the ion where there is a single bond between the two oxygen atoms superoxides containing the ion and many others lithium burns in air to form lithium oxide but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide potassium forms a mixture of potassium peroxide and potassium superoxide while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively their reactivity increases going down the group while lithium sodium and potassium merely burn in air rubidium and caesium are pyrophoric spontaneously catch fire in air

the smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions the peroxide and superoxide due to their small size this attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom this causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature this effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium allowing them to form the less stable peroxides rubidium and caesium at the bottom of the group are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised the oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions in addition the small size of the and ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure under controlled conditions however all the alkali metals with the exception of francium are known to form their oxides peroxides and superoxides the alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful oxidising agents sodium peroxide and potassium superoxide react with carbon dioxide to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas which allows them to be used in submarine air the presence of water vapour naturally present in breath makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient all the stable alkali metals except lithium can form red ozonides through reaction of the powdered anhydrous hydroxide with ozone the ozonides may be then extracted using liquid ammonia they slowly decompose at standard conditions to the superoxides and oxygen and hydrolyse immediately to the hydroxides when in contact with water potassium rubidium and caesium also form sesquioxides which may be better considered peroxide disuperoxides

rubidium and caesium can form a great variety of suboxides with the metals in formal oxidation states below rubidium can form and upon oxidation in air while caesium forms an immense variety of oxides such as the ozonide and several brightly coloured suboxides such as bronze violet dark green cso as well as the last of these may be heated under vacuum to generate

the alkali metals can also react analogously with the heavier chalcogens sulfur selenium tellurium and polonium and all the alkali metal chalcogenides are known with the exception of franciums reaction with an excess of the chalcogen can similarly result in lower chalcogenides with chalcogen ions containing chains of the chalcogen atoms in question for example sodium can react with sulfur to form the sulfide sodium sulfide and various polysulfides with the formula x from to containing the ions due to the basicity of the and ions the alkali metal selenides and telluride chemistry are alkaline in when reacted directly with selenium and tellurium alkali metal polyselenides and polytellurides are formed along with the selenides and tellurides with the and ions they may be obtained directly from the elements in liquid ammonia or when air is not present and are colourless compounds that air oxidises quickly back to selenium or tellurium the alkali metal polonides are all ionic compounds containing the they are very chemically stable and can be produced by direct reaction of the elements at around



the alkali metals are among the most electropositive elements on the periodic table and thus tend to ionic bond to the most electronegative elements on the periodic table the halogens fluorine chlorine bromine iodine and astatine forming salt chemistry known as the alkali metal halides the reaction is very vigorous and can sometimes result in explosions all twenty stable alkali metal halides are the unstable ones are not known with the exception of sodium astatide because of the great instability and rarity of astatine and francium the most of the twenty is certainly sodium chloride otherwise known as common salt all of the stable alkali metal halides have the formula mx where m is an alkali metal and x is a halogen they are all white ionic crystalline solids that have high melting points all the alkali metal halides are solubility in water except for lithium fluoride lif which is insoluble in water due to its very high lattice enthalpy the high lattice enthalpy of lithium fluoride is due to the small sizes of the and ions causing the electrostatic interactions between them to be strong a similar effect occurs for magnesium fluoride consistent with the diagonal relationship between lithium and magnesium

the alkali metals also react similarly with hydrogen to form ionic alkali metal hydrides where the hydride anion acts as a pseudohalogen these are often used as reducing agents producing hydrides complex metal hydrides or hydrogen gas other pseudohalides are also known notably the cyanides these are isostructural to the respective halides except for lithium cyanide indicating that the cyanide ions may rotate freely ternary alkali metal halide oxides such as yellow and are also known the polyhalides are rather unstable although those of rubidium and caesium are greatly stabilised by the feeble polarising power of these extremely large cations














alkali metal cations do not usually form coordination complexes with simple lewis bases due to their low charge of just and their relatively large thus the ion forms most complexes and the heavier alkali metal ions form less and less though exceptions occur for weak complexes lithium in particular has a very rich coordination chemistry in which it exhibits coordination numbers from to although octahedral hexacoordination is its preferred mode in aqueous solution the alkali metal ions exist as octahedral hexahydrate complexes with the exception of the lithium ion which due to its small size forms tetrahedral tetrahydrate complexes the alkali metals form these complexes because their ions are attracted by electrostatic forces of attraction to the polar water molecules because of this anhydrous salts containing alkali metal cations are often used as desiccants alkali metals also readily form complexes with crown ethers eg for for for and for and cryptands due to electrostatic attraction


the alkali metals dissolve slowly in liquid ammonia forming ammoniacal solutions of solvated metal cation and solvated electron which react to form hydrogen gas and the metal metal amides where m represents an alkali metal this was first noted by humphry davy in and rediscovered by w weyl in the process may be speeded up by a catalyst similar solutions are formed by the heavy divalent alkaline earth metals calcium strontium barium as well as the divalent lanthanides europium and ytterbium the amide salt is quite insoluble and readily precipitates out of solution leaving intensely coloured ammonia solutions of the alkali metals in charles the one being referred to has no article on wp identified the colour as being due to the presence of solvated electrons which contribute to the high electrical conductivity of these solutions at low concentrations below m the solution is dark blue and has ten times the conductivity of aqueous sodium at higher concentrations above m the solution is and has approximately the conductivity of liquid metals like mercury element in addition to the alkali metal amide salt and solvated electrons such ammonia solutions also contain the alkali metal cation the neutral alkali metal atom m diatomic molecule alkali metal molecules and alkali metal anions these are unstable and eventually become the more thermodynamically stable alkali metal amide and hydrogen gas solvated electrons are powerful reducing agents and are often used in chemical synthesis

















being the smallest alkali metal lithium forms the widest variety of and most stable organometallic compounds which are bonded covalently organolithium reagent compounds are electrically volatile solids or liquids that melt at low temperatures and tend to form oligomers with the structure rlix where r is the organic group as the electropositive nature of lithium puts most of the charge density of the bond on the carbon atom effectively creating a carbanion organolithium compounds are extremely powerful base chemistry and carbon nucleophile for use as bases butyllithiums are often used and are commercially available an example of an organolithium compound is methyllithium which exists in tetrameric x tetrahedral and hexameric x octahedral forms organolithium compounds especially are useful reagents in organic synthesis as might be expected given lithiums diagonal relationship with magnesium which plays an important role in the grignard reaction for example alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may be used to synthesise aldehydes and ketones by reaction with metal carbonyls the reaction with nickel tetracarbonyl for example proceeds through an unstable acyl nickel carbonyl complex which then undergoes electrophilic substitution to give the desired aldehyde using as the electrophile or ketone using an alkyl halide product





alkyllithiums and aryllithiums may also react with amides to give aldehydes and ketones and symmetrical ketones by reacting with carbon monoxide they thermally decompose to eliminate a producing alkenes and lithium hydride another route is the reaction of ethers with and aryllithiums that act as strong bases in solvents aryllithiums react as the carbanions they effectively are turning carbon dioxide to aromatic carboxylic acids and aryl ketones to tertiary carbinols finally they may be used to synthesise other organometallic compounds through exchange


unlike the organolithium compounds the organometallic compounds of the heavier alkali metals are predominantly ionic the application of organosodium chemistry compounds in chemistry is limited in part due to competition from organolithium compounds which are commercially available and exhibit more convenient reactivity the principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is sodium cyclopentadienide sodium tetraphenylborate can also be classified as an organosodium compound since in the solid state sodium is bound to the aryl groups organometallic compounds of the higher alkali metals are even more reactive than organosodium compounds and of limited utility a notable reagent is schlossers base a mixture of and potassium this reagent reacts with propene to form the compound allylpotassium and equilibrate when in contact with alkali metals whereas isomerisation is fast with lithium and sodium it is slow with the heavier alkali metals the heavier alkali metals also favour the steric hindrance congested conformation several crystal structures of organopotassium compounds have been reported establishing that they like the sodium compounds are polymeric organosodium organopotassium organorubidium and organocaesium compounds are all mostly ionic and are insoluble or nearly so in nonpolar solvents

alkyl and aryl derivatives of sodium and potassium tend to react with air they cause the cleavage of ethers generating alkoxides unlike alkyllithium compounds alkylsodiums and alkylpotassiums cannot be made by reacting the metals with alkyl halides because wurtz coupling occurs


as such they have to be made by reacting organomercury compound compounds with sodium or potassium metal in inert hydrocarbon solvents while methylsodium forms tetramers like methyllithium methylpotassium is more ionic and has the nickel arsenide structure with discrete methyl anions and potassium cations

the alkali metals and their hydrides react with acidic hydrocarbons for example cyclopentadienes and terminal alkynes to give salts liquid ammonia ether or hydrocarbon solvents are used the most common of which being tetrahydrofuran the most important of these compounds is sodium cyclopentadienide an important precursor to many transition metal cyclopentadienyl derivatives similarly the alkali metals react with cyclooctatetraene in tetrahydrofuran to give alkali metal for example dipotassium cyclooctatetraenide is an important precursor to many metal cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives such as uranocene the large and very weakly polarising alkali metal cations can stabilise large aromatic polarisable radical anions such as the sodium naphthalenide a strong reducing agent




upon reacting with oxygen alkali metals form oxides peroxides superoxides and suboxides however the first three are more common the table belowinorganic chemistry by gary l miessler and donald a tar edition pearson shows the types of compounds formed in reaction with oxygen the compound in brackets represents the minor product of combustion














the alkali metal peroxides are ionic compounds that are unstable in water the peroxide anion is weakly bound to the cation and it is hydrolysed forming stronger covalent bonds







with sulphur they form sulphides and polysulphidesthe chemistry of the elements by greenwood and earnshaw edition elsevier

because alkali metal sulphides are essentially salts of a weak acid and a strong base they form basic solutions





lithium is the only metal that combines directly with nitrogen at room temperature






with hydrogen alkali metals form saline hydrides that hydrolyse in water





lithium is the only metal that reacts directly with carbon to give dilithium acetylide na and k can react with acetylene to give acetylidesinorganic chemistry by cotton and wilkinson






on reaction with water they generate hydroxide ions and hydrogen gas this reaction is vigorous and highly exothermic and the hydrogen resulted may ignite in air or even explode in the case of rb and cs




the alkali metals are very good reducing agents they can reduce metal cations that are less electropositive titanium is produced industrially by the reduction of titanium tetrachloride with na at van arkel process




alkali metals react with halogen derivatives to generate hydrocarbon via the wurtz reaction




alkali metals dissolve in liquid ammonia or other donor solvents like aliphatic amines or hexamethylphosphoramide to give blue solutions these solutions are believed to contain free electrons

due to the presence of solvated electrons these solutions are very powerful reducing agents used in organic synthesis




other reductions that can be carried by these solutions are





although francium is the heaviest alkali metal that has been discovered there has been some theoretical work predicting the physical and chemical characteristics of hypothetical heavier alkali metals being the first period element the undiscovered element ununennium element is predicted to be the next alkali metal after francium and behave much like their lighter congener however it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties its chemistry is predicted to be closer to that of potassium or rubidium instead of caesium or francium this is unusual as periodic trends ignoring relativistic effects would predict ununennium to be even more reactive than caesium and francium this lowered reactivity chemistry is due to the relativistic stabilisation of ununenniums valence electron increasing ununenniums first ionisation energy and decreasing the metallic radius and ionic this effect is already seen for francium this assumes that ununennium will behave chemically as an alkali metal which although likely may not be true due to relativistic effects the relativistic stabilisation of the orbital also increases ununenniums electron affinity far beyond that of caesium and indeed ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarisability of ununennium on the other hand ununennium is predicted to continue the trend of melting points decreasing going down the group being expected to have a melting point between and


the stabilisation of ununenniums valence electron and thus the contraction of the orbital cause its atomic radius to be lowered to very close to that of rubidium so that the chemistry of ununennium in the oxidation state should be more similar to the chemistry of rubidium than to that of francium on the other hand the ionic radius of the ion is predicted to be larger than that of because the orbitals are destabilised and are thus larger than the of the lower shells ununennium may also show the oxidation state which is not seen in any other alkali metal in addition to the oxidation state that is characteristic of the other alkali metals and is also the main oxidation state of all the known alkali metals this is because of the destabilisation and expansion of the spinor causing its outermost electrons to have a lower ionisation energy than what would otherwise be expected indeed many ununennium compounds are expected to have a large covalent character due to the involvement of the electrons in the bonding


not as much work has been done predicting the properties of the alkali metals beyond ununennium although a simple extrapolation of the periodic table by the aufbau principle would put element unhexennium under ununennium calculations predict that the next element after ununennium with properties may be element unhexpentium which is predicted to have the electron configuration og this element would be intermediate in properties between an alkali metal and a group element and while its physical and atomic properties would be closer to the former its chemistry may be closer to that of the latter further calculations show that unhexpentium would follow the trend of increasing ionisation energy beyond caesium having an ionisation energy comparable to that of sodium and that it should also continue the trend of decreasing atomic radii beyond caesium having an atomic radius comparable to that of potassium however the electrons of unhexpentium may also be able to participate in chemical reactions along with the electron possibly allowing oxidation states beyond whence the likely transition metal behaviour of unhexpentium due to the alkali and alkaline earth metals both being elements these predictions for the trends and properties of ununennium and unhexpentium also mostly hold quite similarly for the corresponding alkaline earth metals unbinilium ubn and unhexhexium uhh unsepttrium element may be an even better heavier homologue of with a predicted electron configuration of usb it returns to the situation of having one easily removed electron far above a closed in energy and is expected to be even more reactive than caesium

the probable properties of further alkali metals beyond unsepttrium have not been explored yet as of and they may or may not be able to exist in periods and above of the periodic table relativistic and effects become so strong that extrapolations from lighter congeners become completely inaccurate in addition the relativistic and effects which stabilise the and destabilise and expand the and of higher shells have opposite effects causing even larger difference between relativistic and calculations of the properties of elements with such high atomic numbers interest in the chemical properties of ununennium unhexpentium and unsepttrium stems from the fact that they are located close to the expected locations of island of stability centered at elements and nuclear scientists eye future landfall on a second island of stability retrieved on


many other substances are similar to the alkali metals in their tendency to form monopositive cations analogously to the pseudohalogens they have sometimes been called metals these substances include some elements and many more polyatomic the polyatomic ions are especially similar to the alkali metals in their large size and weak polarising power


the element hydrogen with one electron per neutral atom is usually placed at the top of group of the periodic table for convenience but hydrogen is not normally considered to be an alkali when it is considered to be an alkali metal it is because of its atomic properties and not its chemical properties under typical conditions pure hydrogen exists as a diatomic gas consisting of two atoms per molecule however the alkali metals only form diatomic molecules such as dilithium at high temperatures when they are in the gaseous statewinter mark j chemical bonding oxford university press

hydrogen like the alkali metals has one valence electron and reacts easily with the halogens but the similarities mostly end there because of the small size of a bare proton compared to the alkali metal cations its placement above lithium is primarily due to its electron configuration it is sometimes placed above fluorine due to their similar chemical properties though the resemblance is likewise not absolute

the first ionisation energy of hydrogen kilojoule per mole is much higher than that of the alkali metalshuheey keiter ea and keiter rl inorganic chemistry principles of structure and reactivity edition harpercollins new york usajames am and lord mp macmillans chemical and physical data macmillan london uk as only one additional electron is required to fill in the outermost shell of the hydrogen atom hydrogen often behaves like a halogen forming the negative hydride ion and is very occasionally considered to be a halogen on that basis the alkali metals can also form negative ions known as alkalides but these are little more than laboratory curiosities being unstable an argument against this placement is that formation of hydride from hydrogen is endothermic unlike the exothermic formation of halides from halogens the radius of the anion also does not fit the trend of increasing size going down the halogens indeed is very diffuse because its single proton cannot easily control both electrons it was expected for some time that liquid hydrogen would show metallic while this has been shown to not be the case under extremely high pressures such as those found at the cores of jupiter and saturn hydrogen does become metallic and behaves like an alkali in this phase it is known as metallic hydrogen the resistivity of liquid metallic hydrogen at k is approximately equal to that of liquid rubidium and caesium at k at the respective pressures when they undergo a transition

the electron configuration of hydrogen while analogous to that of the alkali metals is unique because there is no subshell hence it can lose an electron to form the hydron chemistry or gain one to form the hydride ion in the former case it resembles superficially the alkali in the latter case the halogens but the differences due to the lack of a subshell are important enough that neither group fits the properties of hydrogen well group is also a good fit in terms of thermodynamic properties such as ionisation energy and electron affinity but hydrogen cannot be tetravalent thus none of the three placements are entirely satisfactory although group is the most common placement if one is chosen because the hydron is by far the most important of all monatomic hydrogen species being the foundation of chemistry as an example of hydrogens unorthodox properties stemming from its unusual electron configuration and small size the hydrogen ion is very small radius around compared to the size of most other atoms and ions and so is nonexistent in condensed systems other than in association with other atoms or molecules indeed transferring of protons between chemicals is the basis of chemistry also unique is hydrogens ability to form hydrogen bonds which are an effect of electrostatic and electron correlative contributing phenomena while analogous lithium bonds are also known they are mostly electrostatic nevertheless hydrogen can take on the same structural role as the alkali metals in some molecular crystals and has a close relationship with the lightest alkali metals especially lithium



the ammonium ion has very similar properties to the heavier alkali metals acting as an alkali metal intermediate between potassium and rubidium and is often considered a close relative for example most alkali metal salt chemistry are solubility in water a property which ammonium salts share ammonium is expected to behave stably as a metal ions in a sea of delocalised electrons at very high pressures though less than the typical pressure where transitions from insulating to metallic behaviour occur around and could possibly occur inside the gas and neptune uranus and neptune which may have significant impacts on their interior magnetic fields it has been estimated that the transition from a mixture of ammonia and dihydrogen molecules to metallic ammonium may occur at pressures just below under standard conditions ammonium can form a metallic amalgam with mercury

other metals include the alkylammonium cations in which some of the hydrogen atoms in the ammonium cation are replaced by alkyl or aryl groups in particular the quaternary ammonium cations are very useful since they are permanently charged and they are often used as an alternative to the expensive to stabilise very large and very easily polarisable anions such as tetraalkylammonium hydroxides like alkali metal hydroxides are very strong bases that react with atmospheric carbon dioxide to form carbonates furthermore the nitrogen atom may be replaced by a phosphorus arsenic or antimony atom the heavier nonmetallic pnictogens creating a phosphonium or arsonium cation that can itself be substituted while stibonium itself is not known some of its organic derivatives are characterised


cobaltocene is a metallocene the cobalt analogue of ferrocene it is a dark purple solid cobaltocene has valence electrons one more than usually found in organotransition metal complexes such as its very stable relative ferrocene in accordance with the rule this additional electron occupies an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the bonds consequently many chemical reactions of are characterized by its tendency to lose this extra electron yielding a very stable cation known as cobaltocenium many cobaltocenium salts coprecipitate with caesium salts and cobaltocenium hydroxide is a strong base that absorbs atmospheric carbon dioxide to form cobaltocenium carbonate like the alkali metals cobaltocene is a strong reducing agent and decamethylcobaltocene is stronger still due to the combined inductive effect of the ten methyl groups cobalt may be substituted by its heavier congener rhodium to give rhodocene an even stronger reducing agent iridocene involving iridium would presumably be still more potent but is not very due to its instability




thallium is the heaviest stable element in group of the periodic table at the bottom of the periodic table the inert pair effect is quite strong because of the relativistic effects stabilisation of the orbital and the decreasing bond energy as the atoms increase in size so that the amount of energy released in forming two more bonds is not worth the high ionisation energies of the electrons it displays the oxidation state that all the known alkali metals display and thallium compounds with thallium in its oxidation state closely resemble the corresponding potassium or silver compounds stoichiometrically due to the similar ionic radii of the and ions it was sometimes considered an alkali metal in continental europe but not in england in the years immediately following its discovery and was placed just after caesium as the sixth alkali metal in dmitri mendeleevs periodic table and julius lothar meyers periodic table mendeleevs periodic table and meyers periodic table put thallium in its current position in the boron group and left the space below caesium blank however thallium also displays the oxidation state which no known alkali metal displays although ununennium the undiscovered seventh alkali metal is predicted to possibly display the oxidation state the sixth alkali metal is now considered to be francium while is stabilised by the inert pair effect this inert pair of electrons is still able to participate chemically so that these electrons are stereochemistry active in aqueous solution additionally the thallium halides except are quite insoluble in water and thalliumi iodide has an unusual structure because of the presence of the stereochemically active inert pair in thallium




















the group element or coinage metals copper silver and gold are typically categorised as transition metals given they can form ions with incomplete physically they have the relatively low melting points and high electronegativity values associated with metals the filled d subshell and free s electron of cu ag and au contribute to their high electrical and thermal conductivity transition metals to the left of group experience interactions between s electrons and the partially filled d subshell that lower electron mobilityrussell am lee kl relations in nonferrous metals new york chemically the group metals behave like metals in their valence states and are hence somewhat related to the alkali metals this is one reason for their previously being labelled as group ib paralleling the alkali metals group ia they are occasionally classified as metalsdeming hg fundamental chemistry john wiley sons new york their spectra are analogous to those of the alkali metals their monopositive ions are paramagnetic and contribute no colour to their salts like those of the alkali metalsbailar j c comprehensive inorganic chemistry vol p

in mendeleevs periodic table copper silver and gold are listed twice once under group viii with the iron triad and platinum group metals and once under group ib group ib was nonetheless parenthesised to note that it was tentative mendeleevs main criterion for group assignment was the maximum oxidation state of an element on that basis the group elements could not be classified in group ib due to the existence of copperii and goldiii compounds being known at that time however eliminating group ib would make group i the only main group group viii was labelled a transition group to lack an bifurcation soon afterward a majority of chemists chose to classify these elements in group ib and remove them from group viii for the resulting symmetry this was the predominant classification until the rise of the modern periodic table which separated the alkali metals and group metals

the coinage metals were traditionally regarded as a subdivision of the alkali metal group due to them sharing the characteristic electron configuration of the alkali metals group group however the similarities are largely confined to the stochiometry of the compounds of both groups and not their chemical properties this stems from the filled d subshell providing a much weaker shielding effect on the outermost s electron than the filled p subshell so that the coinage metals have much higher first ionisation energies and smaller ionic radii than do the corresponding alkali metals furthermore they have higher melting points hardnesses and densities and lower reactivities and solubilities in liquid ammonia as well as having more covalent character in their compounds finally the alkali metals are at the top of the electrochemical series whereas the coinage metals are almost at the very bottom the coinage metals filled d shell is much more easily disrupted than the alkali metals filled p shell so that the second and third ionisation energies are lower enabling higher oxidation states than and a richer coordination chemistry thus giving the group metals clear transition metal character particularly noteworthy is gold forming ionic compounds with rubidium and caesium in which it forms the auride ion which also occurs in solvated form in liquid ammonia solution here gold behaves as a pseudohalogen because its configuration has one electron less than the shell configuration of mercury element












the production of pure alkali metals is somewhat complicated due to their extreme reactivity with commonly used substances such as water from their silicate ores all the stable alkali metals may be obtained the same way sulfuric acid is first used to dissolve the desired alkali metal ion and aluminiumiii ions from the ore leaching whereupon basic precipitation removes aluminium ions from the mixture by precipitating it as the aluminium hydroxide the remaining insoluble alkali metal carbonate is then precipitated the salt is then dissolved in hydrochloric acid to produce the chloride the result is then left to evaporate and the alkali metal can then be isolated lithium and sodium are typically isolated through electrolysis from their liquid chlorides with calcium chloride typically added to lower the melting point of the mixture the heavier alkali metals however is more typically isolated in a different way where a reducing agent typically sodium for potassium and magnesium or calcium for the heaviest alkali metals is used to reduce the alkali metal chloride the liquid or gaseous product the alkali metal then undergoes fractional distillation for purification most routes to the pure alkali metals require the use of electrolysis due to their high one of the few which does not is the pyrolysis of the corresponding alkali metal azide which yields the metal for sodium potassium rubidium and caesium and the nitride for lithium

lithium salts have to be extracted from the water of mineral springs brine pools and brine deposits the metal is produced electrolytically from a mixture of fused lithium chloride and potassium chloride

sodium occurs mostly in seawater and dried seabed but is now produced through electrolysis of sodium chloride by lowering the melting point of the substance to below through the use of a downs cell extremely pure sodium can be produced through the thermal decomposition of sodium azidemerck index ed monograph potassium occurs in many minerals such as sylvite potassium chloride previously potassium was generally made from the electrolysis of potassium chloride or potassium web periodic table of the elements potassium essential information november found extensively in places such as canada russia belarus germany israel united states and jordan in a method similar to how sodium was produced in the late and early it can also be produced from seawater however these methods are problematic because the potassium metal tends to dissolve in its molten chloride and vaporises significantly at the operating temperatures potentially forming the explosive superoxide as a result pure potassium metal is now produced by reducing molten potassium chloride with sodium metal at

although sodium is less reactive than potassium this process works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and can easily be distilled off so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion


for several years in the and a of the potassium production called alkarb was a main source for rubidium alkarb contained rubidium while the rest was potassium and a small fraction of caesium today the largest producers of caesium for example the tanco mine in manitoba canada produce rubidium as from pollucite today a common method for separating rubidium from potassium and caesium is the fractional crystallization chemistry of a rubidium and caesium alum caesium which yields pure rubidium alum after approximately recrystallisations the limited applications and the lack of a mineral rich in rubidium limit the production of rubidium compounds to to tonnes per year caesium however is not produced from the above reaction instead the mining of pollucite ore is the main method of obtaining pure caesium extracted from the ore mainly by three methods acid digestion alkaline decomposition and direct reduction both metals are produced as of lithium production after when interest in lithiums thermonuclear properties increased sharply the production of rubidium and caesium also increased correspondingly pure rubidium and caesium metals are produced by reducing their chlorides with calcium metal at and low pressure

as a result of its extreme rarity in nature most francium is synthesised in the nuclear reaction neutron yielding and the greatest quantity of francium ever assembled to date is about neutral atoms which were synthesised using the nuclear reaction given above when the only natural isotope is specifically required it is produced as the alpha daughter of itself produced synthetically from the neutron irradiation of natural one of the daughters of natural



lithium sodium and potassium have many applications while rubidium and caesium are very useful in academic contexts but do not have many applications yet lithium is often used in battery and lithium oxide can help process silica lithium stearate is a thickener and can be used to make lubricating it is produced from lithium hydroxide which is also used to absorb carbon dioxide in space capsules and submarines lithium chloride is used as a brazing alloy for aluminium parts metallic lithium is used in alloys with magnesium and aluminium to give very tough and light alloys

sodium compounds have many applications the most being sodium chloride as table salt sodium salts of fatty acids are used as soap pure sodium metal also has many applications including use in lamp which produce very efficient light compared to other types of lighting and can help smooth the surface of other metals being a strong reducing agent it is often used to reduce many other metals such as titanium and zirconium from their chlorides furthermore it is very useful as a liquid in fast breeder nuclear reactors due to its low melting point viscosity and physics towards neutron absorption

potassium compounds are often used as fertilisers as potassium is an important element for plant nutrition potassium hydroxide is a very strong base and is used to control the ph of various substances potassium nitrate and potassium permanganate are often used as powerful oxidising agents potassium superoxide is used in breathing masks as it reacts with carbon dioxide to give potassium carbonate and oxygen gas pure potassium metal is not often used but its alloys with sodium may substitute for pure sodium in fast breeder nuclear reactors

rubidium and caesium are often used in atomic clocks caesium atomic clocks are extraordinarily if a clock had been made at the time of the dinosaurs it would be off by less than four seconds after million years for that reason caesium atoms are used as the definition of the second rubidium ions are often used in purple fireworks and caesium is often used in drilling fluids in the petroleum industry

francium has no commercial applications but because of franciums relatively simple atomic structure among other things it has been used in spectroscopy experiments leading to more information regarding energy levels and the coupling constants between subatomic particles studies on the light emitted by ions have provided accurate data on transitions between atomic energy levels similar to those predicted by quantum mechanics




pure alkali metals are dangerously reactive with air and water and must be kept away from heat fire oxidising agents acids most organic compounds halocarbons plastics and moisture they also react with carbon dioxide and carbon tetrachloride so that normal fire extinguishers are counterproductive when used on alkali metal fires some class d dry powder fire extinguisher designed for metal fires are effective depriving the fire of oxygen and cooling the alkali metal

experiments are usually conducted using only small quantities of a few grams in a fume hood small quantities of lithium may be disposed of by reaction with cool water but the heavier alkali metals should be dissolved in the less reactive isopropanol the alkali metals must be stored under mineral oil or an inert atmosphere the inert atmosphere used may be argon or nitrogen gas except for lithium which reacts with nitrogen rubidium and caesium must be kept away from air even under oil because even a small amount of air diffused into the oil may trigger formation of the dangerously explosive for the same reason potassium should not be stored under oil in an atmosphere for longer than months



the bioinorganic chemistry of the alkali metal ions has been extensively reviewed
solid state crystal structures have been determined for many complexes of alkali metal ions in small peptides nucleic acid constituents carbohydrates and ionophore complexes

lithium naturally only occurs in traces in biological systems and has no known biological role but does have effects on the body when ingested lithium carbonate is used as a mood stabiliser in psychiatry to treat bipolar disorder in daily doses of about to although there are excessive ingestion of lithium causes drowsiness slurred speech and vomiting among other symptoms and poisons the central nervous system which is dangerous as the required dosage of lithium to treat bipolar disorder is only slightly lower than the toxic web periodic table of the elements lithium biological information february its biochemistry the way it is handled by the human body and studies using rats and goats suggest that it is an essential element trace element although the natural biological function of lithium in humans has yet to be identified

sodium and potassium occur in all known biological systems generally functioning as electrolytes inside and outside cell biology sodium is an essential nutrient that regulates blood volume blood pressure osmotic equilibrium and the minimum physiological requirement for sodium is per day sodium chloride also known as common salt is the principal source of sodium in the diet and is used as seasoning and preservative such as for pickling and jerky most of it comes from processed foods the dietary reference intake for sodium is per day but most people in the united states consume more than per day the minimum amount that promotes this in turn causes million premature deaths worldwide

potassium is the major cation positive ion inside cell web periodic table of the elements potassium biological information january while sodium is the major cation outside animal web periodic table of the elements sodium biological information january the concentration differences of these charged particles causes a difference in electric potential between the inside and outside of cells known as the membrane potential the balance between potassium and sodium is maintained by ion transporter proteins in the cell membrane the cell membrane potential created by potassium and sodium ions allows the cell to generate an action spike of electrical discharge the ability of cells to produce electrical discharge is critical for body functions such as neurotransmission muscle contraction and heart function disruption of this balance may thus be fatal for example ingestion of large amounts of potassium compounds can lead to hyperkalemia strongly influencing the cardiovascular system potassium chloride is used in the united states for lethal injection executions


due to their similar atomic radii rubidium and caesium in the body mimic potassium and are taken up similarly rubidium has no known biological role but may help stimulate web webelements periodic table of the elements rubidium biological information february and similarly to caesium replace potassium in the body causing hypokalemia partial substitution is quite possible and rather a person contains on average of rubidium and an increase in this value by to times did not show negative effects in test persons rats can survive up to substitution of potassium by rubidium rubidium and to a much lesser extent caesium can function as temporary cures for while rubidium can adequately physiologically substitute potassium in some systems caesium is never able to do so there is only very limited evidence in the form of deficiency symptoms for rubidium being possibly essential in even if this is true the trace amounts usually present in food are more than enough

caesium compounds are rarely encountered by most people but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic like rubidium caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body but is significantly larger and is therefore a poorer web periodic table of the elements caesium biological information january excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia arrythmia and acute cardiac arrest but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources as such caesium is not a major chemical environmental pollutant the median lethal dose value for caesium chloride in mice is per kilogram which is comparable to the values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy but has been linked to the deaths of over patients on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatmentwood leonie

radioisotopes of caesium require special precautions the improper handling of gamma ray sources can lead to release of this radioisotope and radiation injuries perhaps the case is the accident of in which an radiation therapy system from an abandoned clinic in the city of brazil was scavenged from a junkyard and the glowing caesium chloride sold to curious uneducated buyers this led to four deaths and serious injuries from radiation exposure together with and was among the isotopes distributed by the chernobyl disaster which constitute the greatest risk to health radioisotopes of francium would presumably be dangerous as well due to their high decay energy and short but none have been produced in large enough amounts to pose any serious risk


























































































an alphabet is a standardized set of basic written symbols or graphemes called letter that represent the phonemes of certain spoken languages not all writing systems represent language in this in a syllabary each character represents a syllable for instance and logogram use characters to represent words morphemes or other semantic units

the first fully phonemic script the script later known as the phoenician alphabet is considered to be the first alphabet and is the ancestor of most modern alphabets including arabic alphabet cyrillic alphabet greek alphabet hebrew alphabet latin alphabet and possibly brahmic scripts it was created by workers and slaves in the sinai peninsula as the script by selecting a small number of egyptian hieroglyphs commonly seen in their ancient egypt to acrophony as opposed to the semantic values of their own canaanite languages peter t daniels however distinguishes an abugida or alphasyllabary a set of graphemes that represent consonantal base letters which diacritics modify to represent vowels as in devanagari and other south asian scripts an abjad in which letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants as in the original phoenician hebrew alphabet or arabic script and an alphabet a set of graphemes that represent both vowels and consonants in this narrow sense of the word the first true alphabet was the greek alphabet which was developed on the basis of the earlier phoenician alphabet

of the dozens of alphabets in use today the most popular is the latin alphabet which was derived from the greek alphabet and which many languages modify by adding letters formed using diacritical marks while most alphabets have letters composed of lines linear writing there are also writing such as the alphabets used in braille the khmer alphabet for cambodian language is the longest with letters

alphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters this makes them useful for purposes of collation specifically by allowing words to be sorted in alphabetical order it also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of numbering ordered items in such contexts as numbered lists and number placements


the english word alphabet came into middle english from the late latin word alphabetum which in turn originated in the greek language the greek word was made from the first two letters alpha and beta the names for the greek letters came from the first two letters of the phoenician aleph which also meant ox and bet letter which also meant house

sometimes like in the alphabet song in english the term abcs is used instead of the word alphabet now i know my abcs knowing ones abcs in general can be used as a metaphor for knowing the basics about anything






the history of the alphabet started in ancient egypt egyptian writing had a set of some egyptian uniliteral signs that are called uniliterals to represent syllables that begin with a single consonant of their language plus a vowel or no vowel to be supplied by the native speaker these glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for logograms to write grammatical inflections and later to transcribe loan words and foreign names


in the middle bronze age an apparently alphabetic system known as the script appears in egyptian turquoise mines in the sinai peninsula dated to circa the century bc apparently left by canaanite workers in john and deborah darnell discovered an even earlier version of this first alphabet at wadi dated to circa bc and showing evidence of having been adapted from specific forms of egyptian hieroglyphs that could be dated to circa bc strongly suggesting that the first alphabet had been developed about that time based on letter appearances and names it is believed to be based on egyptian hieroglyphs this script had no characters representing vowels although originally it probably was a syllabary but unneeded symbols were discarded an alphabetic cuneiform script with signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in ugarit before the century bc this script was not used after the destruction of ugaritugaritic writing online

the script eventually developed into the phoenician alphabet which is conventionally called before c bc the oldest text in phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of king ahiram this script is the parent script of all western alphabets by the tenth century two other forms can be distinguished namely canaanite language and aramaic alphabet the aramaic gave rise to the hebrew alphabet script the south arabian alphabet a sister script to the phoenician alphabet is the script from which the geez alphabet an abugida is descended vowelless alphabets are called abjads currently exemplified in scripts including arabic alphabet hebrew alphabet and syriac alphabet the omission of vowels was not always a satisfactory solution and some weak consonants are sometimes used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable mater lectionis these letters have a dual function since they are also used as pure consonants

the or script and the ugaritic script were the first scripts with a limited number of signs in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time cuneiform egyptian hieroglyphs and linear b the phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn another advantage of phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages since it recorded words phonemically

the script was spread by the phoenicians across the mediterranean in greece the script was modified to add vowels giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the west it was the first alphabet in which vowels have independent letter forms separate from those of consonants the greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in greek to represent vowels vowels are significant in the greek language and the syllabical linear b script that was used by the mycenaean greece greeks from the century bc had symbols including vowels in its early years there were many variants of the greek alphabet a situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it



the greek alphabet in its euboean alphabet was carried over by greek colonists to the italian peninsula where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the italic languages one of these became the latin alphabet which was spread across europe as the romans expanded their empire even after the fall of the roman state the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works it eventually became used for the descendant languages of latin the romance languages and then for most of the other languages of europe

some adaptations of the latin alphabet are augmented with ligature typography such as in danish language and icelandic language and ou letter in algonquian by borrowings from other alphabets such as the thorn letter in old english language and icelandic language which came from the runic alphabet and by modifying existing letters such as the eth letter of old english and icelandic which is a modified d other alphabets only use a subset of the latin alphabet such as hawaiian and italian language which uses the letters j k x y and w only in foreign words

another notable script is elder futhark which is believed to have evolved out of one of the old italic alphabets elder futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the runic alphabets the runic alphabets were used for germanic languages from ad to the late middle ages its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood these alphabets have since been replaced with the latin alphabet except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the century

the old hungarian script is a contemporary writing system of the hungarians it was in use during the entire history of hungary albeit not as an official writing system from the century it once again became more and more popular

the glagolitic alphabet was the initial script of the liturgical language old church slavonic and became together with the greek uncial script the basis of the cyrillic script cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts and is notable for its use in slavic languages and also for other languages within the former soviet union cyrillic alphabets include the serbian cyrillic alphabet macedonian alphabet bulgarian alphabet russian alphabet belarusian alphabet and ukrainian alphabet the glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by saints cyril and methodius while the cyrillic alphabet was invented by clement of ohrid who was their disciple they feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the greek alphabet and the hebrew alphabet

the longest european alphabet is the slovak alphabet which has letters


beyond the logographic written chinese many phonetic scripts are in existence in asia the arabic alphabet hebrew alphabet syriac alphabet and other abjads of the middle east are developments of the aramaic alphabet

most alphabetic scripts of india and eastern asia are descended from the brahmi script which is often believed to be a descendant of aramaic



in korea the hangul alphabet was created by sejong the majesty created characters himself it is hunminjeongeum name for the annals of the choson dynasty hangul is a unique alphabet it is a featural alphabet where many of the letters are designed from a sounds place of articulation p to look like the widened mouth l to look like the tongue pulled in its design was planned by the government of the and it places individual letters in syllable clusters with equal dimensions in the same way as chinese characters to allow for writing one syllable always takes up one no matter how many letters get stacked into building that one

zhuyin sometimes called bopomofo is a used to phonetically transcribe standard chinese in the taiwan after the later establishment of the china and its adoption of pinyin the use of zhuyin today is limited but it is still widely used in taiwan where the republic of china still governs zhuyin developed out of a form of chinese shorthand based on chinese characters in the early and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary like an alphabet the phonemes of syllable onset are represented by individual symbols but like a syllabary the phonemes of the syllable rime are rather each possible final excluding the syllable medial is represented by its own symbol for example luan is represented as where the last symbol represents the entire final while zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system it is still often used in ways similar to a romanization is for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for chinese characters on computers and cellphones

european alphabets especially latin and cyrillic have been adapted for many languages of asia arabic is also widely used sometimes as an abjad as with urdu alphabet and persian alphabet and sometimes as a complete alphabet as with kurdish alphabet and uyghur alphabet

















the term alphabet is used by linguistics and paleographers in both a wide and a narrow sense in the wider sense an alphabet is a script that is segmental at the phoneme is it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words in the narrower sense some scholars distinguish true alphabets from two other types of segmental script abjads and abugidas these three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels abugidas are also but indicate vowels with diacritics to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants in alphabets in the narrow sense on the other hand consonants and vowels are written as independent lettersfor critics of the distinction see reinhard g lehmann how many letters needs an the case of semitic in the idea of writing writing across borders edited by alex de voogt and joachim friedrich quack leiden brill p esp p the earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the middle bronze age alphabets believed to be an abjad which through its successor phoenician alphabet is the ancestor of modern alphabets including arabic alphabet greek alphabet latin alphabet via the old italic alphabet cyrillic via the greek alphabet and hebrew alphabet via aramaic alphabet

examples of abjads are the arabic script and hebrew true alphabets include latin script cyrillic and korean and abugidas are used to write tigrinya language amharic language hindi and thai language the canadian aboriginal syllabics are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply since each glyph stands for a consonant that is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel in a true syllabary each combination would be represented by a separate glyph

all three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs ugaritic script for example is basically an abjad but has syllabic letters for these are the only time vowels are indicated cyrillic is basically a true alphabet but has syllabic letters for coptic alphabet has a letter for devanagari is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels though some traditions use as a zero consonant as the graphic base for such vowels

the boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always for example sorani kurdish language is written in the arabic script which is normally an abjad however in kurdish writing the vowels is mandatory and full letters are used so the script is a true alphabet other languages may use a semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics effectively making them abugidas on the other hand the phagspa script of the mongol empire was based closely on the tibetan script but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks although short a was not written as in the indic abugidas one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet conversely the vowel marks of the geez alphabet and the geez alphabet ironically the original source of the term abugida have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script even more extreme the pahlavi abjad eventually became logogram see below

thus the primary categorisation of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels for tone linguistics further classification can be based on their treatment of tone though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types some alphabets disregard tone entirely especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load as in somali language and many other languages of africa and the americas such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels most commonly tones are indicated with diacritics the way vowels are treated in abugidas this is the case for vietnamese alphabet a true alphabet and thai alphabet an abugida in thai tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant with diacritics for disambiguation in the pollard script an abugida vowels are indicated by diacritics but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone more rarely a script may have separate letters for tones as is the case for hmong alphabet and zhuang alphabet for most of these scripts regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used the most common tone is not marked just as the most common vowel is not marked in indic in zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone like the virama of indic

the number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small the book pahlavi scripts script an abjad had only twelve letters at one point and may have had even fewer later on today the rotokas alphabet has only twelve letters the hawaiian alphabet is sometimes claimed to be as small but it actually consists of letters including the and five long vowels however hawaiian braille has only letters while rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent just eleven book pahlavi was small because many letters had been is the graphic distinctions had been lost over time and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in arabic alphabet another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes for example a letter represented g d y k or j however such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated in later pahlavi papyrus up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all but instead each word had to be learned as a is they had become logograms as in egyptian demotic egyptian

the largest segmental script is probably an abugida devanagari when written in devanagari vedic sanskrit has an alphabet of letters including the visarga mark for final aspiration and special letters for and though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used the hindi alphabet must represent both sanskrit and modern vocabulary and so has been expanded to with the khutma letters letters with a dot added to represent sounds from persian and english thai has a total of symbols consisting of consonants vowels and syllabics not including diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length

the largest known abjad is sindhi language with letters the largest alphabets in the narrow sense include kabardian language and abkhaz language for cyrillic with and letters respectively and slovak language for the latin script with however these scripts either count digraph orthography as separate letters as spanish did with ch and ll until recently or uses diacritics like slovak

the georgian alphabet is an alphabetic writing system with letters it is the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent the original georgian alphabet had letters but letters were removed in the century by ilia chavchavadze the georgian alphabet is much closer to greek than the other caucasian alphabets the letter order parallels the greek with the consonants without a greek equivalent organized at the end of the alphabet the origins of the alphabet are still unknown some armenian and western scholars believe it was created by mesrop mashtots armenian mesrop also known as mesrob the vartabed who was an early medieval armenian linguist theologian statesman and hymnologist best known for inventing the armenian alphabet warren bowersock peter robert lamont brown oleg grabar late antiquity a guide to the postclassical world harvard university press p james r russell alphabets mastoc was a charismatic visionary who accomplished his task at a time when armenia stood in danger of losing both its national identity through partition and its newly acquired christian faith through sassanian pressure and reversion to paganism by preaching in armenian he was able to undermine and the discourse founded in native tradition and to create a counterweight against both byzantine and syriac cultural hegemony in the church mastoc also created the georgian and alphabets based on the armenian model other georgiangeorgian and western scholars are against this theory most scholars link the creation of the georgian script to the process of christianization of iberia a core georgian kingdom of kartli the alphabet was therefore most probably created between the conversion of iberia under king mirian iii of iberia or and the bir el qutt inscriptions of p contemporaneously with the armenian alphabet

syllabaries typically contain to glyphs and the glyphs of logographic systems typically number from the many hundreds into the thousands thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script

the armenian alphabet or is a graphically unique alphabetical writing system that has been used to write the armenian language it was created in year ad originally contained letters two more letters o and f were added in the middle ages during the orthography reform a new letter capital was added which was a ligature before while the letter was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter which was a digraph before



the armenian scripts directionality is horizontal like the latin and greek alphabets it also uses bicameral script like those the armenian word for alphabet is named after the first two letters of the armenian alphabet ayb and ben



alphabets often come to be associated with a standard ordering of their letters which can then be used for purposes of for the listing of words and other items in what is called alphabetical order


























which is derived from the northwest semitic abgad orderreinhard g lehmann how many letters needs an the case of semitic in the idea of writing writing across borders edited by alex de voogt and joachim friedrich quack leiden brill p is well established although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters such as the french language and and of certain combinations of letters multigraph in french these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation however in icelandic language the accented letters such as and are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from the sounds represented by their unaccented counterparts in spanish is considered a separate letter but accented vowels such as and are not the ll and ch were also considered single letters but in the real academia changed the collating order so that ll is between lk and lm in the dictionary and ch is between cg and ci and in the tenth congress of the association of spanish language academies changed it so they were no longer letters at allreal academia spanish spanish alphabet spanish april january spanish pronto spanish english medical translators la i griega se ye cuba debate retrieved december cubadebatecu

in german words starting with which spells the german phoneme are inserted between words with initial and all incidentally loanwords instead of appearing after initial sz as though it were a single contrast to several languages such as albanian alphabet in which and all representing phonemes and considered separate single letters would follow the letters d e g l n r t x and z respectively as well as hungarian and welsh further german words with an diaeresis are collated ignoring the to turkish alphabet that adopted the graphemes and and where a word like would come after tuz in the dictionary an exception is the german telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like ae since names such as also appear with the spelling jaeger and are not distinguished in the spoken language

the danish orthography and norwegian orthography alphabets end with whereas the swedish and finnish orthography ones conventionally put at the end

it is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence some alphabets today such as the hanunoo script are learned one letter at a time in no particular order and are not used for collation where a definite order is required however a dozen ugaritic alphabet tablets from the fourteenth century bc preserve the alphabet in two sequences one the abcde order later used in phoenician has continued with minor changes in hebrew alphabet greek alphabet armenian alphabet gothic alphabet cyrillic and latin the other was used in southern arabia and is preserved today in geez alphabet both orders have therefore been stable for at least years

runic alphabet used an unrelated elder futhark sequence which was later younger futhark arabic alphabet uses its own sequence although arabic retains the traditional abjadi order for numbering

the brahmic family of alphabets used in india use a unique order based on phonology the letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth this organization is used in southeast asia tibet korean hangul and even japanese kana which is not an alphabet


the phoenician letter names in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound acrophony continue to be used to varying degrees in samaritan alphabet aramaic alphabet syriac alphabet hebrew alphabet greek alphabet and arabic alphabet

the names were abandoned in latin alphabet which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel usually e before or after the the two exceptions were y and z which were borrowed from the greek alphabet rather than etruscan and were known as y graeca greek y pronounced i graeca greek i and zeta from discrepancy was inherited by many european languages as in the term zed for z in all forms of english other than american english over time names sometimes shifted or were added as in double u for w double v in french the english name for y and american zee for z comparing names in english and french gives a clear reflection of the great vowel shift a b c and d are pronounced in todays english but in contemporary french they are the french names from which the english names are derived preserve the qualities of the english vowels from before the great vowel shift by contrast the names of f l m n and s remain the same in both languages because short vowels were largely unaffected by the shift

in cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on slavic this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in latin





when an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language an orthography generally comes into being providing rules for the spelling of words in that language in accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the phonemes significant sounds of the spoken language in a perfectly phonemic orthography there would be a consistent correspondence between the letters and the phonemes so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling and vice versa however this ideal is not usually achieved in some languages such as spanish language and finnish language come close to it while others such as english deviate from it to a much larger degree

the pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language

languages may fail to achieve a correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways







national languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard some national languages like finnish language armenian language turkish language russian language language serbian language croatian language and bosnian language and bulgarian language have a very regular spelling system with a nearly correspondence between letters and phonemes strictly speaking these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb to spell meaning to split a word into its letters the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables similarly the italian language verb corresponding to spell out compitare is unknown to many italians because spelling is usually trivial as italian spelling is highly phonemic in standard spanish language one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling but not vice versa as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way but a given letter is consistently pronounced french language with its silent letters and its heavy use of nasal vowels and elision may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation but its rules on pronunciation though complex are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy

at the other extreme are languages such as english where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in a consistent way for english this is partly because the great vowel shift occurred after the orthography was established and because english has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times retaining their original spelling at varying levels even english has general albeit complex rules that predict pronunciation from spelling and these rules are successful most of the rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate

sometimes countries have the written language undergo a spelling reform to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language these can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself as when turkey switched from the arabic alphabet to a turkish alphabet

the standard system of symbols used by linguists to represent sounds in any language independently of orthography is called the international phonetic alphabet












































































































atom model of the hydrogen atom or a ion in this model it is an essential feature that the photon energy or frequency of the electromagnetic radiation emitted shown when an electron jumps from one orbital to another be proportional to the mathematical square of atomic charge experimental measurement by henry moseley of this radiation for many elements from to showed the results as predicted by bohr both the concept of atomic number and the bohr model were thereby given scientific

the atomic number or proton number symbol z of a chemical element is the number of protons found in the atomic nucleus of every atom of that element the atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element it is identical to the charge number of the nucleus in an electric charge atom the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons

the sum of the atomic number z and the neutron number n gives the mass number a of an atom since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes and the binding change of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass the atomic mass of any atom when expressed in atomic mass unit making a quantity called the atomic mass is within of the whole number a

atoms with the same atomic number but different neutron numbers and hence different mass numbers are known as isotopes a little more than of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes see monoisotopic elements and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element called the relative atomic mass in a defined environment on earth determines the elements standard atomic weight historically it was these atomic weights of elements in comparison to hydrogen that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the century

the conventional symbol z comes from the german language word meaning number which before the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics merely denoted an elements numerical place in the periodic table whose order is approximately but not completely consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights only after with the suggestion and evidence that this z number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms did the word and its english equivalent atomic number come into common use in this context





loosely speaking the existence or construction of a periodic table of elements creates an ordering of the elements and so they can be numbered in order

dmitri mendeleev claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables first published on march in order of atomic weight atomgewicht the periodic table of elements american institute of physics however in consideration of the elements observed chemical properties he changed the order slightly and placed tellurium atomic weight ahead of iodine atomic weight the development of the periodic table royal society of chemistry this placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number z but that number was not known or suspected at the time


a simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory however besides the case of iodine and tellurium later several other pairs of elements such as argon and potassium cobalt and nickel were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties however the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar lanthanide elements whose atomic number was not obvious led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from lutetium element onward hafnium was not known at this time


in ernest rutherford gave a rutherford model of the atom in which a central nucleus held most of the atoms mass and a positive charge which in units of the electrons charge was to be approximately equal to half of the atoms atomic weight expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms this central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight though it was almost different from the atomic number of gold the single element from which rutherford made his nevertheless in spite of rutherfords estimation that gold had a central charge of about but was element on the periodic table a month after rutherfords paper appeared antonius van den broek first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was exactly equal to its place in the periodic table also known as element number atomic number and symbolized z this proved eventually to be the case



the experimental position improved dramatically after research by henry moseley in ordering the elements in the periodic table royal chemical society moseley after discussions with bohr who was at the same lab and who had used van den broeks hypothesis in his bohr model of the atom decided to test van den broeks and bohrs hypothesis directly by seeing if spectral lines emitted from excited atoms fitted the bohr theorys postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of z

to do this moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions k and l lines produced by the elements from aluminum to gold used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an tube the square root of the frequency of these photons increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression this led to the conclusion moseleys law that the atomic number does closely correspond with an offset of one unit for in moseleys work to the calculated electric charge of the nucleus ie the element number z among other things moseley demonstrated that the lanthanide series from lanthanum to lutetium inclusive must have fewer and no was far from obvious from known chemistry at that time


after moseleys death in the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium were examined by his method there were seven elements with which were not found and therefore identified as still undiscovered corresponding to atomic numbers and scerri a tale of seven elements oxford university press from to all seven of these missing elements were discoveredscerri chaps one chapter per element by this time the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium


in the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of z which were now recognized to be the same as the element number was not understood an old idea called prouts hypothesis had postulated that the elements were all made of residues or protyles of the lightest element hydrogen which in the model had a single electron and a nuclear charge of one however as early as rutherford and thomas royds had shown that alpha particles which had a charge of were the nuclei of helium atoms which had a mass four times that of hydrogen not two times if prouts hypothesis were true something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms

in rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a nuclear reaction between alpha particles and nitrogen ernest rutherford nzhistorynetnz new zealand history nzhistorynetnz october retrieved on and believed he had proven prouts law he called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in alternate names being proutons and protyles it had been immediately apparent from the work of moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of hydrogen nuclei and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra protons presumed present in all heavy nuclei a helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two nuclear electrons electrons bound inside the nucleus to cancel two of the charges at the other end of the periodic table a nucleus of gold with a mass times that of hydrogen was thought to contain electrons in the nucleus to give it a residual charge of consistent with its atomic number


all consideration of nuclear electrons ended with james chadwicks discovery of the neutron in an atom of gold now was seen as containing neutrons rather than nuclear electrons and its positive charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of after therefore an elements atomic number z was also realized to be identical to the proton number of its nuclei


the conventional symbol z possibly comes from the german language word atomic number origin of symbol z frostburgedu however prior to the word zahl simply number was used for an elements assigned number in the periodic table


each element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom which is z the atomic number the electron configuration of these electrons follows from the principles of quantum mechanics the number of electrons in each elements electron shells particularly the outermost valence shell is the primary factor in determining its chemical bonding behavior hence it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of any mixture of atoms with a given atomic number


the quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers as of all elements with atomic numbers to have been observed synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created in general the of a nuclide becomes shorter as atomic number increases though undiscovered nuclides with certain magic number physics numbers of protons and neutrons may have relatively longer and comprise an island of stability
















































anatomy greek dissection is the branch of biology concerned with the study of the structure of organisms and their partsmerriam webster dictionary anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things it is an old science having its beginnings in prehistoric times anatomy is inherently tied to developmental biology embryology comparative anatomy evolutionary biology and phylogeny as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated both over immediate and timescales anatomy and physiology which study the structure and function biology of organisms and their parts respectively make a natural pair of multidisciplinary approach and are often studied together human body is one of the essential basic sciences that are applied science in medicine

the discipline of anatomy is divided into macroscopic scale and microscopic scale macroscopic anatomy or gross anatomy is the examination of an animals body parts using unaided eyesight gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissue biology of various structures known as histology and also in the study of cell biology

the history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organ anatomy and structures of the human body methods have also improved dramatically advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers corpses to century medical imaging techniques including radiography ultrasound imaging and magnetic resonance imaging




derived from the ancient greek dissection from i cut up cut open from up and i cutode edition anatomy is the scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems organs and tissue biology it includes the appearance and position of the various parts the materials from which they are composed their locations and their relationships with other parts anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved for example an anatomist is concerned with the shape size position structure blood supply and innervation of an organ such as the while a physiologist is interested in the production of bile the role of the liver in nutrition and the regulation of bodily functions

the discipline of anatomy can be subdivided into a number of branches including gross or macroscopic scale anatomy and microscopic scale anatomy gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy the study by sight of the external body features microscopic anatomy is the study of structures on a microscopic scale along with histology the study of tissues and embryology the study of an organism in its immature condition

anatomy can be studied using both invasive and methods with the goal of obtaining information about the structure and organization of organs and systems methods used include dissection in which a body is opened and its organs studied and endoscopy in which a video instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures angiography using or magnetic resonance angiography are methods to visualize blood vessels

the term anatomy is commonly taken to refer to human anatomy however substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals the term zootomy is also sometimes used to specifically refer to animals the structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy



the kingdom biology animalia contains multicellular organisms that are heterotrophic and motility although some have secondarily adopted a sessility most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissue biology and these animals are also known as eumetazoans they have an internal digestion chamber with one or two the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryogenesis metazoans do not include the sponges which have undifferentiated cells

unlike plant cells animal cells have neither a cell wall nor chloroplasts vacuoles when present are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell the body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell including those found in muscles nerves and skin each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids cytoplasm and a cell nucleus all of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblasty and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblasty all of a triploblastic animals tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo the ectoderm mesoderm and endoderm

animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types connective tissue epithelium muscle tissue and nervous tissue



connective tissues are fibrous and made up of cells scattered among inorganic material called the extracellular matrix connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place the main types are loose connective tissue adipose tissue fibrous connective tissue cartilage and bone the extracellular matrix contains proteins the chief and most abundant of which is collagen collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues the matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body an exoskeleton is a thickened rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralisation biology as in crustaceans or by the of its proteins as in insects an endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals as well as in many of those less developed



epithelial tissue is composed of closely packed cells bound to each other by cell adhesion molecules with little intercellular space epithelial cells can be squamous epithelial cell flat simple cuboidal epithelium or columnar epithelial cell and rest on a basal lamina the upper layer of the basement membrane the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells there are many different types of epithelium modified to suit a particular function in the respiratory tract there is a type of pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium epithelial in the small intestine there are microvillus on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villus skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body keratinocytes make up to of the cells in the epidermis skinmcgrath eady pope fm rooks textbook of dermatology ed blackwell publishing pp the epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle in simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins in more advanced animals many glands are formed of epithelial cells



myocyte myocytes form the active contractile tissue of the body muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion either locomotion or movement within internal organs muscle is formed of contractile myofibril and is separated into three main smooth muscle tissue skeletal striated muscle and cardiac muscle smooth muscle has no striated muscle tissue when examined microscopically it contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths it is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension it is found in the movement of appendages and jaws obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two the filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions in higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus bladder intestines stomach oesophagus respiratory airways and blood vessels cardiac muscle is found only in the heart allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body



nervous tissue is composed of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information in some radial symmetry marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians including sea anemones and jellyfish the nerves form a nerve net but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles in simple animals receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus in more complex animals specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptor cell are found in groups and send messages along biological neural network to other parts of the organism neurons can be connected together in ganglion in higher animals specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system brain and spinal cord and a peripheral nervous system the latter consists of sensory neuron that transmit information from sense organs and motor neuron that influence target organs the peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle certain glands and internal organs including the stomach




all vertebrates have a similar basic body plan and at some point in their lives mostly in the embryogenesis stage share the major chordate a stiffening rod the a dorsal hollow tube of nervous material the neural pharyngeal and a tail posterior to the anus the spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gut anatomy is below it nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm connective tissues are derived from mesoderm and gut is derived from the endoderm at the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut the mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal and the anus at the base of the tail the defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae in most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs however a few vertebrates such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood gnathostomata are typified by paired appendages fins or legs which may be secondarily lost the limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homology biology because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor this is one of the arguments put forward by charles darwin to support his theory of evolution




the body of a fish is divided into a head trunk and tail although the divisions between the three are not always externally visible the skeleton which forms the support structure inside the fish is either made of cartilage in cartilaginous fish or bone in bony fish the main skeletal element is the vertebral column composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong the ribs attach to the spine and there are no limb anatomy or limb girdles the main external features of the fish the fish fin are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays which with the exception of the caudal fins have no direct connection with the spine they are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk the heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop the eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision there is an inner ear but no external or middle ear low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure

sharks and rays are basal phylogenetics fish with numerous primitive phylogenetics anatomical features similar to those of ancient fish including skeletons composed of cartilage their bodies tend to be flattened they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head the dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales they have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open but not a swim bladder cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large egg yolk eggs some species are ovoviviparous and the young develop internally but others are oviparous and the larvae develop externally in egg cases

the bony fish lineage shows more derived trait anatomical traits often with major evolutionary changes from the features of ancient fish they have a bony skeleton are generally laterally flattened have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum fish and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout the dermis is covered with overlapping fish scale bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column but not a cloaca they mostly spawn biology a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column





amphibians are a class biology of animals comprising frogs salamanders and caecilians they are tetrapods but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae their skulls are mostly broad and short and are often incompletely ossified their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales but contains many mucous glands and in some species poison glands the hearts of amphibians have three chambers two atrium heart and one ventricle heart they have a urinary bladder and metabolic wastes are excreted primarily as urea amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal membrane region through the nostrils these are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat they supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist

in frogs the pelvic girdle is robust and the hind legs are much longer and stronger than the forelimbs the feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing frogs have large eyes and no tail salamanders resemble lizards in their short legs project sideways the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless they burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side




reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles tuataras lizards snakes and crocodiles they are tetrapods but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians the teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size the surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls the heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams the reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization with a sex organ present in most species the eggs are surrounded by amniote which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land or ovoviviparity in some species the bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid

turtles are notable for their protective shells they have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below these are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine the neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp horny plates in aquatic species the front legs are modified into flippers

tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the triassic period there is one living species sphenodon punctatus the skull has two openings fenestrae on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull there is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews the teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down the brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchus the tuatara has a parietal eye on its forehead

lizards have skulls with only one nasal fenestra on each side the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost this results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider lizards are mostly quadrupeds with the trunk held off the ground by short legs but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes lizards have moveable eyelids eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye

snakes are closely related to lizards having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the cretaceous period and they share many of the same features the skeleton consists of a skull a hyoid bone spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs the bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole snakes lack moveable eyelids the eyes being covered by transparent spectacle scales they do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate prey

crocodilians are large aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth the head and trunk are flattened and the tail is laterally compressed it undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming the tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull the nostrils eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged unlike other reptiles crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood




birds are tetrapods but though their hind limbs are used for walking or hopping their front limbs are wings covered with feathers and adapted for flight birds are endothermic have a high metabolic rate a light skeleton and powerful muscles the long bones are thin hollow and very light air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones the sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused there are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a beak the eyes are relatively large particularly in nocturnal species such as owls they face forwards in predators and sideways in ducks

the feathers are outgrowths of the epidermis zoology and are found in localized bands from where they fan out over the skin large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail contour feathers cover the birds surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds the only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail this produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird personal grooming there are scales on the legs feet and claws on the tips of the toes



mammals are a diverse class of animals mostly terrestrial but some are aquatic and others have evolved flapping or gliding flight they mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings the legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk which is held well clear of the ground the bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth which are usually differentiated are coated in a layer of tooth enamel the teeth are shed once deciduous teeth during the animals lifetime or not at all as is the case in cetaceans mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear they are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat gland some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands producing milk to feed the young mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular thoracic diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs the mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate nitrogenous waste is excreted primarily as urea

mammals are amniotes and most are viviparity giving birth to live young the exception to this are the monotremes the platypus and the echidnas of australia most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment but in marsupials the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mothers pouch marsupial where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development





humans have the overall body plan of a mammal humans have a human head neck trunk anatomy which includes the thorax and abdomen two arms and hands and two human leg and foot

generally students of certain biology paramedics prosthetists and orthotists physical therapy occupational therapy nursing podiatry and medical school learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models skeletons textbooks diagrams photographs lectures and tutorials and in addition medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers the study of microscopic anatomy or histology can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations or slides under a microscope


human anatomy physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school human anatomy can be taught regionally or that is respectively studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest or studying by specific systems such as the nervous or respiratory systems the major anatomy textbook grays anatomy has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format in line with modern teaching methods a thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians especially surgery and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties such as histopathology and radiology


academic anatomists are usually employed by universities medical schools or teaching hospitals they are often involved in teaching anatomy and research into certain systems organs tissues or cells



invertebrates constitute a vast array of living organisms ranging from the simplest unicellular eukaryotes such as paramecium to such complex multicellular animals as the octopus lobster and dragonfly they constitute about of the animal species by definition none of these creatures has a backbone the cells of protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs locomotion is often provided by cilium or flagellum or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia food may be gathered by phagocytosis energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton some protozoans can form multicellular colonies

metazoans are a multicellular organism with different groups of cells serving different functions the most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates the outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism an endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms sponges and some cephalopods exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods insects spiders ticks shrimps crabs lobsters calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of mollusca brachiopods and some polychaete and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians polyp sea anemones and the collagenous cuticle of annelids the outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells gland cells and stinging cells there may also be protrusions such as microvillus cilia bristles spine zoology and tubercles

marcello malpighi the father of microscopical anatomy discovered that plants had tubules similar to those he saw in insects like the silk worm he observed that when a portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves and being captured above the ring



arthropods comprise the largest phylum in the animal kingdom with over a million known invertebrate speciesbritannica concise encyclopaedia

insects possess segmentation biology bodies supported by a outer covering the exoskeleton made mostly of chitin the segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts a head a thorax insect anatomy and an abdomen the head typically bears a pair of sensory antenna biology a pair of compound eyes one to three simple eyes ocelli and three sets of modified appendages that form the insect mouthparts the thorax has three pairs of segmented arthropod leg one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of insect wing the abdomen is composed of eleven segments some of which may be fused and houses the digestion respiration physiology excretion and reproductive systems there is considerable variation between species and many adaptations to the body parts especially wings legs antennae and mouthparts

spiders a class of arachnids have four pairs of a body of two cephalothorax and an abdomen spiders have no wings and no antennae they have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous they have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax these have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs at the end of each male pedipalp is a cymbium that acts to support the palpal bulb












in bce the edwin smith papyrus an ancient egyptian medicine medical manual described the heart its vessels liver spleen kidneys hypothalamus uterus and urinary bladder and showed the blood vessels diverging from the heart the ebers papyrus c bce features a treatise on the heart with vessels carrying all the bodys fluids to or from every member of the body

ancient greek anatomy and physiology underwent great changes and advances throughout the early medieval world over time this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain eye liver reproductive organs and the nervous system

the hellenistic egyptian city of alexandria was the for greek anatomy and physiology alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the greeks but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers great patronage of the arts and sciences from the ptolemy rulers helped raise alexandria up further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other greek states



some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in hellenistic alexandria two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were herophilus and erasistratus these two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research they also conducted vivisections on the cadavers of condemned criminals which was considered taboo until the was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls than veins and that the atria were parts of the heart herophiluss knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain eye liver reproductive organs and nervous system and characterizing the course of disease erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain including the cavities and membranes and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum during his study in alexandria erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems he was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart which was then carried throughout the body his distinction between the arteries and arteries carrying the air through the body while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart including the tricuspid during the third century greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses it was herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the seat of intellect and not a cooling chamber as propounded by aristotle herophilus is also credited with describing the optic oculomotor motor division of the trigeminal facial vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves




great feats were made during the third century bce in both the digestive and reproductive systems herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands but the small intestine and liver he showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes he recognized that spermatozoa were produced by the testes and was the first to identify the prostate gland

the anatomy of the muscles and skeleton is described in the hippocratic corpus an ancient greek medical work written by unknown authors aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection praxagoras identified the difference between artery and veins also in the century bce herophilos and erasistratus produced more accurate anatomical descriptions based on vivisection of criminals in alexandria during the ptolemaic kingdom alexandrian medicine antiqua medicina from homer to vesalius university of virginia

in the century galen of pergamum an anatomist clinician writer and philosophy wrote the final and highly influential anatomy treatise of ancient times he compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals he was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animalsbrock arthur john translator galen on the natural faculties edinburgh introduction page xxxiii galens drawings based mostly on dog anatomy became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years his work was known to renaissance doctors only through islamic golden age medicine until it was translated from the greek some time in the century







anatomy developed little from classical times until the sixteenth as the historian marie boas writes progress in anatomy before the sixteenth century is as mysteriously slow as its development after is startlingly rapid between and the anatomists mondino de luzzi alessandro achillini and antonio benivieni at bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times mondinos anatomy of was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy it describes the body in the order followed in mondinos dissections starting with the abdomen then the thorax then the head and limbs it was the standard anatomy textbook for the next century

leonardo da vinci was trained in anatomy by andrea del verrocchio he made use of his anatomical knowledge in his artwork making many sketches of skeletal structures muscles and organs of humans and other vertebrates that he dissected

andreas vesalius latinized from andries van wezel professor of anatomy at the university of padua is considered the founder of modern human anatomy originally from duchy of brabant vesalius published the influential book de humani corporis fabrica the structure of the human body a large format book in seven volumes in andreas de humani corporis fabrica libri septem basileae basel ex officina joannis oporini the accurate and intricately detailed illustrations often in allegory poses against italianate landscapes are thought to have been made by the artist jan van calcar a pupil of titianomalley cd andreas vesalius of brussels berkeley university of california press

in england anatomy was the subject of the first public lectures given in any these were given by the barber surgeon in the century joined in by the lumleian lectures in surgery at the royal college of physicians



in the united states medical schools began to be set up towards the end of the century classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain philadelphia baltimore and new york were all renowned for body snatching activity as criminals raided graveyards at night removing newly buried corpses from their coffins a similar problem existed in britain where demand for bodies became so great that and even anatomy murder were practised to obtain cadaversrosner lisa the anatomy murders being the true and spectacular history of edinburghs notorious burke and hare and of the man of science who abetted them in the commission of their most heinous crimes university of pennsylvania press some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers the practice was halted in britain by the anatomy act of while in the united states similar legislation was enacted after the physician william s forbes of jefferson medical college was found guilty in of complicity with resurrectionists in the despoliation of graves in lebanon cemetery

the teaching of anatomy in britain was transformed by sir john struthers anatomist regius professor of anatomy aberdeen at the university of aberdeen from to he was responsible for setting up the system of three years of academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine including especially anatomy this system lasted until the reform of medical training in and as well as teaching he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy published over research papers and became famous for his public dissection of the tay whale from the royal college of surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy and were often used in teaching ignaz semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused he noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives the students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically

before the modern medical era the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were dissection of the dead and inspection palpation and auscultation of the living it was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the angular resolution of the microscope and around matthias jakob schleiden and theodor schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue advances in the fields of histology and cell biology began in the late century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens the invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them about the same time in the the use of diffraction for studying the crystal structures of proteins nucleic acids and other biological molecules gave rise to a new field of molecular anatomy

equally important advances have occurred in techniques for examining the interior structures of the body can be passed through the body and used in medical radiography and fluoroscopy to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness magnetic resonance imaging computed tomography and medical ultrasonography have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations






















































affirming the consequent sometimes called converse error fallacy of the converse or confusion of necessity and sufficiency is a formal fallacy of taking a true indicative conditional statement eg if the lamp were broken then the room would be dark and invalidly inferring its converse the room is dark so the lamp is broken even though the converse may not be true this arises when a consequent the room would be dark has more than one other possible antecedents for example the lamp is not plugged in or the lamp is in working order but is switched off

converse errors are common in everyday thinking and communication and can result from among other causes communication issues misconceptions about logic and failure to consider other causes

the opposite statement modus tollens is a valid form of argument


affirming the consequent is the action of taking a true statement p q and invalidly concluding its converse q p the name affirming the consequent derives from using the consequent q of p q to conclude the antecedent p this illogic can be summarized formally as p q p or alternatively q

the root cause of such a logic error is sometimes failure to realize that just because p is a possible condition for q p may not be the only condition for q ie q may follow from another condition as well

affirming the consequent can also result from overgeneralizing the experience of many statements having true converses if p and q are equivalent statements ie p q it is possible to infer p under the condition q for example the statements it is august so it is my birthday p q and it is my birthday so it is august q p are equivalent and both true consequences of the statement august is my birthday an abbreviated form of p q using one statement to conclude the other is not an example of affirming the consequent but some people may misapply the approach




one way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion for example





owning fort knox is not the only way to be rich any number of other ways to be rich exist

however one can affirm with certainty that if someone is not rich then this person does not own fort knox this is the contrapositive of the first statement and it must be true if and only if the original statement is true



here is another useful example but one that does not require familiarity with who bill gates is and what united states bullion depository is





here it is immediately intuitive that any number of other antecedents if an animal is a deer if an animal is an elephant if an animal is a moose etc can give rise to the consequent then it has four legs and that it is preposterous to suppose that having four legs must imply that the animal is a dog and nothing else this is useful as a teaching example since most people can immediately recognize that the conclusion reached must be wrong intuitively a cat cannot be a dog and that the method by which it was reached must therefore be fallacious



arguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing as in the following example





being thrown off the top of the eiffel tower is not the only cause of death since there exist numerous different causes of death

affirming the consequent is commonly used in rationalization psychology and thus appears as a coping mechanism in some people



in the chaplain is interrogated for supposedly being washington washington who has been blocking out large portions of soldiers letters home the colonel has found such a letter but with the chaplains name signed





p in this case is the chaplain signs his own name and q the chaplains name is written the chaplains name may be written but he did not necessarily write it as the colonel falsely concludes

upon returning from the research expedition in tarkovsky applied at the state institute of cinematography gerasimov institute of cinematography and was admitted to the program he was in the same class as irma raush whom he married in april

the early history of the soviet union offered good opportunities for young film directors before annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors after more films were produced many of them by young directors the khrushchev thaw relaxed soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of european and north american literature films and music this allowed tarkovsky to see films of the italian neorealism french new wave and of directors such as akira kurosawa luis ingmar bergman robert bresson andrzej wajda whose film ashes and diamonds influenced and kenji mizoguchi

tarkovskys teacher and mentor was mikhail romm who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors in tarkovsky directed his first student short film the killers film from a short story of ernest hemingway the short film there will be no leave today and the screenplay concentrate screenplay followed in and

an important influence on tarkovsky was the film director grigory chukhray who was teaching at the vgik impressed by the talent of his student chukhray offered tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film clear skies tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects
